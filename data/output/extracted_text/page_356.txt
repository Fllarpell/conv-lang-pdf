bytes ties up 32 KB of disk space. If the average file is, say, 8 KB, then with a
32-KB block, three quarters of the disk will be wasted, not a terribly efficient way
to use the disk. With an 8-KB file and a 4-KB block, there is no disk wastage, but
the price paid is more RAM eaten up by the FAT . With a 4-KB block and a 2-GB
disk partition, there are 512K blocks, so the FAT must have 512K entries in 
memory (occupying 2 MB of RAM).
MS-DOS uses the FAT to keep track of free disk blocks. Any block that is not
currently allocated is marked with a special code. When MS-DOS needs a new
disk block, it searches the FAT for an entry containing this code. Thus no bitmap or
free list is required.
4.5.2 The UNIX V7 File System
Even early versions of UNIX had a fairly sophisticated multiuser file system
since it was derived from MULTICS. Below we will discuss the V7 file system,
the one for the PDP-11 that made UNIX famous. We will examine a modern
UNIX file system in the context of Linux in Chap. 10.
The file system is in the form of a tree starting at the root directory, with the
addition of links, forming a directed acyclic graph. File names can be up to 14
characters and can contain any ASCII characters except / (because that is the 
separator between components in a path) and NUL (because that is used to pad out
names shorter than 14 characters). NUL has the numerical value of 0.
A UNIX directory entry contains one entry for each file in that directory. Each
entry is extremely simple because UNIX uses the i-node scheme illustrated in
Fig. 4-15. A directory entry contains only two fields: the file name (14 bytes) and
the number of the i-node for that file (2 bytes), as shown in Fig. 4-34. These
parameters limit the number of files per file system to 64K.
Like the i-node of Fig. 4-15, the UNIX i-node contains some attributes. The
attributes contain the file size, three times (creation, last access, and last 
modification), owner, group, protection information, and a count of the number of directory
