bytes (actually only 4086 × 512 bytes because 10 of the disk addresses were used
as special markers, such as end of file, bad block, etc.). With these parameters, the
maximum disk partition size was about 2 MB and the size of the FAT table in
memory was 4096 entries of 2 bytes each. Using a 12-bit table entry would have
been too slow.
This system worked well for floppy disks, but when hard disks came out, it
became a problem. Microsoft solved the problem by allowing additional block
sizes of 1 KB, 2 KB, and 4 KB. This change preserved the structure and size of
the FAT -12 table, but allowed disk partitions of up to 16 MB.
Since MS-DOS supported four disk partitions per disk drive, the new FAT -12
file system worked up to 64-MB disks. Beyond that, something had to give. What
happened was the introduction of FAT -16, with 16-bit disk pointers. Additionally,
block sizes of 8 KB, 16 KB, and 32 KB were permitted. (32,768 is the largest
power of two that can be represented in 16 bits.) The FAT -16 table now occupied
128 KB of main memory all the time, but with the larger memories by then 
available, it was widely used and rapidly replaced the FAT -12 file system. The largest
disk partition that can be supported by FAT -16 is 2 GB (64K entries of 32 KB
each) and the largest disk, 8 GB, namely four partitions of 2 GB each. For quite a
while, that was good enough.
But not forever. For business letters, this limit is not a problem, but for storing
digital video using the DV standard, a 2-GB file holds just over 9 minutes of video.
As a consequence of the fact that a PC disk can support only four partitions, the
largest video that can be stored on a disk is about 38 minutes, no matter how large
the disk is. This limit also means that the largest video that can be edited on line is
less than 19 minutes, since both input and output files are needed.
Starting with the second release of Windows 95, the FAT -32 file system, with
its 28-bit disk addresses, was introduced and the version of MS-DOS underlying
Windows 95 was adapted to support FAT -32. In this system, partitions could 
theoretically be 228 × 215 bytes, but they are actually limited to 2 TB (2048 GB) 
because internally the system keeps track of partition sizes in 512-byte sectors using
a 32-bit number, and 29 × 232 is 2 TB. The maximum partition size for various
block sizes and all three FAT types is shown in Fig. 4-33.
In addition to supporting larger disks, the FAT -32 file system has two other
advantages over FAT -16. First, an 8-GB disk using FAT -32 can be a single 
partition. Using FAT -16 it has to be four partitions, which appears to the Windows user
as the C:, D:, E:, and F: logical disk drives. It is up to the user to decide which file
to place on which drive and keep track of what is where.
The other advantage of FAT -32 over FAT -16 is that for a given size disk 
partition, a smaller block size can be used. For example, for a 2-GB disk partition,
FAT-16 must use 32-KB blocks; otherwise with only 64K available disk addresses,
it cannot cover the whole partition. In contrast, FAT -32 can use, for example,
4-KB blocks for a 2-GB disk partition. The advantage of the smaller block size is
that most files are much shorter than 32 KB. If the block size is 32 KB, a file of 10
