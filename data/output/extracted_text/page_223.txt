Figure 3-8. The position and function of the MMU. Here the MMU is shown as
being a part of the CPU chip because it commonly is nowadays. However, 
logically it could be a separate chip and was years ago.
The virtual address space consists of fixed-size units called pages. The 
corresponding units in the physical memory are called page frames. The pages and page
frames are the same size. In this example they are 4 KB, but page sizes from 512
bytes to a gigabyte have been used in real systems. With 64 KB of virtual address
space and 32 KB of physical memory, we get 16 virtual pages and 8 page frames.
Transfers between RAM and nonvolatile storage are always in whole pages. Many
processors support multiple page sizes that can be mixed and matched as the 
operating system sees fit. For instance, the x86-64 architecture supports 4-KB, 2-MB,
and 1-GB pages, so we could use 4-KB pages for user applications and a single
1-GB page for the kernel. We will see later why it is sometimes better to use a 
single large page, rather than a large number of small ones.
The notation in Fig. 3-9 is as follows. The range marked 0K–4K means that
the virtual or physical addresses in that page are 0 to 4095. The range 4K–8K
refers to addresses 4096 to 8191, and so on. Each page contains exactly 4096
addresses starting at a multiple of 4096 and ending one shy of a multiple of 4096.
When the program tries to access address 0, for example, using the instruction
MOV REG,0
virtual address 0 is sent to the MMU. The MMU sees that this virtual address falls
in page 0, that is, in the range of 0 to 4095, which according to its mapping is page
frame 2 (8192 to 12287). It thus transforms the address to 8192 and outputs
address 8192 onto the bus. The memory knows nothing at all about the MMU and
just sees a request for reading or writing address 8192, which it honors. Thus, the
MMU has effectively mapped all virtual addresses between 0 and 4095 onto 
physical addresses 8192 to 12287.
