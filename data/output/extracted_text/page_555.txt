VIRTUALIZATION AND THE CLOUD
CHAP. 7
21. Briefly explain why memory is so difficult to virtualize well in practice? Explain your
answer.
22. Running multiple virtual machines on a PC is known to require large amounts of 
memory. Why? Can you think of any ways to reduce the memory usage? Explain.
23. Explain the concept of shadow page tables, as used in memory virtualization.
24. One way to handle guest operating systems that change their page tables using 
ordinary (nonprivileged) instructions is to mark the page tables as read only and take a trap
when they are modified. How else could the shadow page tables be maintained? 
Discuss the efficiency of your approach versus the read-only page tables.
25. Why are balloon drivers used? Is this cheating?
26. Describe a situation in which balloon drivers do not work.
27. Explain the concept of deduplication as used in memory virtualization.
28. Computers have had DMA for doing I/O for decades. Did this cause any problems
before there were I/O MMUs?
29. What is a virtual appliance? Why is such a thing useful?
30. PCs differ in minor ways at the very lowest level, things like how timers are managed,
how interrupts are handled, and some of the details of DMA. Do these differences
mean that virtual appliances are not actually going to work well in practice? Explain
your answer.
31. Give one advantage of cloud computing over running your programs locally. Giv e one
disadvantage as well.
32. Give an example of IAAS, PAAS, SAAS, and FAAS.
33. Why is virtual machine migration important? Under what circumstances might it be
useful?
34. Migrating virtual machines may be easier than migrating processes, but migration can
still be difficult. What problems can arise when migrating a virtual machine?
