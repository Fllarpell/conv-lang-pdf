Figure 7-10. The VMware Hosted Architecture and its three components: VMX,
VMM driver, and VMM.
These components each have different functions and operate independently
from one another:
1. A user-space program (the VMX) which the user perceives to be the
VMware program. The VMX performs all UI functions, starts the 
virtual machine, and then performs most of the device emulation (front
end), and makes regular system calls to the host operating system for
the back end interactions. There is typically one multithreaded VMX
process per virtual machine.
2. A small kernel-mode device driver (the VMX driver), which gets
installed within the host operating system. It is used primarily to
allow the VMM to run by temporarily suspending the entire host
operating system. There is one VMX driver installed in the host 
operating system, typically at boot time.
3. The VMM, which includes all the software necessary to multiplex the
CPU and the memory, including the exception handlers, the 
trap-andemulate handlers, the binary translator, and the shadow paging 
module. The VMM runs in kernel mode, but it does not run in the context
of the host operating system. In other words, it cannot rely directly on
services offered by the host operating system, but it is also not 
constrained by any rules or conventions imposed by the host operating
system. There is one VMM instance for each virtual machine, created
when the virtual machine starts.
