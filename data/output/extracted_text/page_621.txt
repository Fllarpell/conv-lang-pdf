server automatically, even if dir1 and dir2 exist on both servers. The problem is
that moving the file automatically changes its path name from /server1/dir1/dir2/x
to /server2/dir1/dir2/x. Programs that have the former string built into them will
cease to work if the path changes. A system in which files can be moved without
their names changing is said to have location independence. A distributed system
that embeds machine or server names in path names clearly is not location 
independent. One based on remote mounting is not, either, since it is not possible to
move a file from one file group (the unit of mounting) to another and still be able
to use the old path name. Location independence is not easy to achieve, but it is a
desirable property to have in a distributed system.
To summarize what we said earlier, there are three common approaches to file
and directory naming in a distributed system:
