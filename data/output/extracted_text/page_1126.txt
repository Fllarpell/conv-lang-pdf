Wirth, ‘‘A Plea for Lean Software’’
Another classic. Niklaus Wirth, a famous and experienced system designer,
makes the case here for lean and mean software based on a few simple concepts,
instead of the bloated mess that much commercial software is. He makes his point
by discussing his Oberon system, a network-oriented, GUI-based operating system
that fits in 200 KB, including the Oberon compiler and text editor.
