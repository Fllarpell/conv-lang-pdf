INTRODUCTION 
CHAP. 1
key abstractions, the most important of which are processes and threads, address
spaces, and files. Accordingly the next three chapters are devoted to these topics.
Chapter 2 is about processes and threads. It discusses their properties and how
they communicate with one another. It also gives a number of detailed examples
of how interprocess communication works and how to avoid some of the pitfalls.
In Chap. 3 we study address spaces and their adjunct, memory management.
The important topic of virtual memory will be examined, together with paging.
Then, in Chap. 4, we come to the topic of file systems. To a considerable
extent, what the user sees is the file system. We will look at both the file-system
interface and the file-system implementation.
Input/Output is covered in Chap. 5. We will cover the concept of device
(in)dependence using examples such as storage devices, keyboards, and displays.
Chapter 6 is about deadlocks, including ways to prevent or avoid them.
At this point, we will have completed our study of the basic principles of 
single-CPU operating systems. However, there is more to say, especially about
advanced topics. In Chap. 7, we examine virtualization. We discuss both the 
principles, and some of the existing virtualization solutions in detail.
Another
advanced topic is multiprocessor systems, including multicores, parallel 
computers, and distributed systems. These subjects are covered in Chap. 8. Another
important subject is operating system security, which we cover in Chap 9.
Next we have some case studies of real operating systems. These are UNIX,
Linux, and Android (Chap. 10), and Windows 11 (Chap. 11). The text concludes
with some wisdom and thoughts about operating system design in Chap. 12.
1.11 METRIC UNITS
To avoid any confusion, it is worth stating explicitly that in this book, as in
computer science in general, metric units are used instead of traditional English
units (the furlong-stone-fortnight system). The principal metric prefixes are listed
in Fig. 1-31. The prefixes are typically abbreviated by their first letters, with the
units greater than 1 capitalized. Thus a 1-TB database occupies 1012 bytes of 
storage and a 100-psec (or 100-ps) clock ticks every 10<10 seconds. Since milli and
micro both begin with the letter ‘‘m,’’ a choice had to be made. Normally, ‘‘m’’ is
for milli and ‘‘µ’’ (the Greek letter mu) is for micro.
It is also worth pointing out that, in common industry practice, the units for
measuring memory sizes have slightly different meanings. There kilo means 210
(1024) rather than 103 (1000) because memories are always a power of two. Thus a
1-KB memory contains 1024 bytes, not 1000 bytes. Similarly, a 1-MB memory
contains 220 (1,048,576) bytes and a 1-GB memory contains 230 (1,073,741,824)
bytes. However, a 1-Kbps communication line transmits 1000 bits per second and a
1-Gbps LAN runs at 1,000,000,000 bits/sec because these speeds are not powers of
two. Unfortunately, many people tend to mix up these two systems, especially for
