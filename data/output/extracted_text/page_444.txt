Bitmaps
The GDI procedures are examples of vector graphics. They are used to place
geometric figures and text on the screen. They can be scaled easily to larger or
smaller screens (provided the number of pixels on the screen is the same). They
are also relatively device independent.
Not all the images that computers manipulate can be generated using vector
graphics. Photographs and videos, for example, do not use vector graphics. 
Instead, these items are scanned in by overlaying a grid on the image. The average
red, green, and blue values of each grid square are then sampled and saved as the
value of one pixel. Such a file is called a bitmap. There are extensive facilities in
Windows for manipulating bitmaps.
Another use for bitmaps is for text. One way to represent a particular character
in some font is as a small bitmap. Adding text to the screen then becomes a matter
of moving bitmaps. One general way to use bitmaps is through a procedure called
BitBlt. It is called as follows:
BitBlt(dsthdc, dx, dy, wid, ht, srchdc, sx, sy, rasterop);
In its simplest form, it copies a bitmap from a rectangle in one window to a 
rectangle in another window (or the same one). The first three parameters specify the
destination window and position. Then come the width and height. Next come the
source window and position. Note that each window has its own coordinate 
system, with (0, 0) in the upper left-hand corner of the window. The last parameter
will be described below. The effect of
BitBlt(hdc2, 1, 2, 5, 7, hdc1, 2, 2, SRCCOPY);
is shown in Fig. 5-38. Notice carefully that the entire 5 Ã— 7 area of the letter A has
been copied, including the background color.
