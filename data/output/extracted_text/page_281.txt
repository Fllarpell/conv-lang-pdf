ied to the hardware from memory, at one word every 100 nsec. If each process runs for
100 msec (including the time to load the page table), what fraction of the CPU time is
devoted to loading the page tables?
15. Suppose that a machine has 48-bit virtual addresses and 32-bit physical addresses.
(a) If pages are 4 KB, how many entries are in the page table if it has only a single
level? Explain.
(b) Suppose this same system has a TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) with 32
entries. Furthermore, suppose that a program contains instructions that fit into one
page and it sequentially reads long integer elements from an array that spans 
thousands of pages. How effective will the TLB be for this case?
16. You are given the following data about a virtual memory system:
(a) The TLB can hold 1024 entries and can be accessed in 1 clock cycle (1 nsec).
(b) A page table entry can be found in 100 clock cycles or 100 nsec.
(c) The average page replacement time is 6 msec.
If page references are handled by the TLB 99% of the time, and only 0.01% lead to a
page fault, what is the effective address-translation time?
17. Suppose that a machine has 38-bit virtual addresses and 32-bit physical addresses.
(a) What is the main advantage of a multilevel page table over a single-level one?
(b) With a two-level page table, 16-KB pages, and 4-byte entries, how many bits
should be allocated for the top-level page table field and how many for the 
nextlevel page table field? Explain.
18. Section 3.3.4 states that the Pentium Pro extended each entry in the page table 
hierarchy to 64 bits but still could only address only 4 GB of memory. Explain how this
statement can be true when page table entries have 64 bits.
19. A computer with a 32-bit address uses a two-level page table. Virtual addresses are
split into a 9-bit top-level page table field, an 11-bit second-level page table field, and
an offset. How large are the pages and how many are there in the address space?
20. A computer has 32-bit virtual addresses and 4-KB pages. The program and data 
together fit in the lowest page (0â€“4095) The stack fits in the highest page. How many
entries are needed in the page table if traditional (one-level) paging is used? How
many page table entries are needed for two-level paging, with 10 bits in each part?
21. Below is an execution trace of a program fragment for a computer with 512-byte
pages. The program is located at address 1020, and its stack pointer is at 8192 (the
stack grows toward 0). Give the page reference string generated by this program. Each
instruction occupies 4 bytes (1 word) including immediate constants. Both instruction
and data references count in the reference string.
Load word 6144 into register 0
Push register 0 onto the stack
Call a procedure at 5120, stacking the return address
Subtract the immediate constant 16 from the stack pointer
Compare the actual parameter to the immediate constant 4
