being with someone and thus always having potential access to sensitive 
information such as their location. This makes the evolution of Android around privacy
an interesting case-study in how these issues have been evolving in the industry.
Androidâ€™s initial approach to privacy was security-focused: every application
needed to declare in its manifest the sensitive data and capabilities it needed access
to, and the platform strictly enforced this. The user experience revolved around
showing the users what the app would have access to before it was installed, 
allowing them to decide if they were okay with it having that information before going
forward to install (and with confidence it would not get any other information once
installed). An example of this user experience is shown in Fig. 10-72.
