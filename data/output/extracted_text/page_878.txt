There are still normal permissions, but they are no longer shown to the user at
all. Instead, the platform still restricts access to them, so that information in the
manifest can be used to audit applications with guarantees about what they can and
cannot do on the device. The remaining permissions from before that are now
auditable normal permissions are shown in Fig. 10-77.

This organizational change effectively moved the permission design from 
security-centric to privacy-centric. The new permission groups represent separate types
of data the user may be interested in protecting, and everything else has been 
hidden from them.
