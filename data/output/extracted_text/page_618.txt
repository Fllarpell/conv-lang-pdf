whistles have recently been grafted onto the Web, the underlying paradigm is still
clearly present: the Web is a great big directed graph of documents that can point
to other documents, as shown in Fig. 8-32.

Figure 8-32. The Web is a big directed graph of documents.
Each Web page has a unique address, called a URL (Uniform Resource 
Locator), of the form protocol://DNS-name/file-name. The protocol is most commonly
http (HyperText Transfer Protocol), and its secure cousin https, but ftp and others
also exist. Then comes the DNS name of the host containing the file. Finally, there
is a local file name telling which file is needed. Thus, a URL uniquely specifies a
single file worldwide
The way the whole system hangs together is as follows. The Web is 
fundamentally a client-server system, with the user being the client and the Website being the
server. When the user provides the browser with a URL, either by typing it in or
clicking on a hyperlink on the current page, the browser takes certain steps to fetch
the requested Web page. As a simple example, suppose the URL provided is
http://www.minix3.org/getting-started/index.html. The browser then takes the 
following steps to get the page.
1. The browser asks DNS for the IP address of www.minix3.org.
2. DNS replies with 66.147.238.215.
3. The browser makes a TCP connection to port 80 on 66.147.238.215.
4. It then sends a request asking for the file getting-started/index.html.
5. The www.minix3.org server sends the file getting-started/index.html.
6. The browser displays all the text in getting-started/index.html.
7. Meanwhile, the browser fetches and displays all images on the page.
8. The TCP connection is released.
