UMA Multiprocessors Using Crossbar Switches
Even with the best caching, the use of a single bus limits the size of a UMA
multiprocessor to about 16 or 32 CPUs. To go beyond that, a different kind of
interconnection network is needed. The simplest circuit for connecting n CPUs to k
memories is the crossbar switch, shown in Fig. 8-3. Crossbar switches have been
used for decades in telephone switching exchanges to connect a group of incoming
lines to a set of outgoing lines in an arbitrary way.
At each intersection of a horizontal (incoming) and vertical (outgoing) line is a
crosspoint. A crosspoint is a small electronic switch that can be electrically 
opened or closed, depending on whether the horizontal and vertical lines are to be 
connected or not. In Fig. 8-3(a), we see three crosspoints closed simultaneously,
allowing connections between the (CPU, memory) pairs (010, 000), (101, 101),
and (110, 010) at the same time. Many other combinations are also possible. In
fact, the number of combinations is equal to the number of different ways eight
rooks can be safely placed on a chess board.

One of the nicest properties of the crossbar switch is that it is a nonblocking
network, meaning that no CPU is ever denied the connection it needs because
