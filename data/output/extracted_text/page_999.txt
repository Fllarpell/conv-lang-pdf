pages, it is the address of the prototype PTE. To be able to edit the PTE when in a
different process address space, the PFN entry also contains the page frame index
of the page that contains the PTE.

Additionally the PFN entry contains forward and backward links for the
aforementioned page lists and various flags, such as read in progress, write in
progress, and so on. To sav e space, the lists are linked together with fields referring
to the next element by its index within the table rather than pointers. The table
entries for the physical pages are also used to summarize the dirty bits found in the
various page table entries that point to the physical page (i.e., because of shared
pages). There is also information used to represent differences in memory pages on
larger server systems which have memory that is faster from some processors than
from others, namely NUMA machines.
One important PFN entry field is priority. The memory manager maintains
page priority for every physical page. Page priorities range from 0 to 7 and reflect
how ‘‘important’’ a page is or how likely it is to get re-accessed. The memory 
manager ensures that higher-priority pages are more likely to remain in memory rather
than getting paged out and reused. Working set trimming policy takes page priority
into account by trimming lower-priority pages before higher-priority ones even if
they are more recently accessed. Even though we generally talk about the standby
list as if it is a single list, it is actually composed of eight lists, one for each 
priority. When a page is inserted into the standby list, it is linked to the appropriate 
sublist based on its priority. When the memory manager is repurposing pages off the
standby list, it does so starting with the lowest-priority sublists. That way, 
higher-priority pages are more likely to avoid getting repurposed.
