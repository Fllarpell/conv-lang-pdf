MEMORY MANAGEMENT 
CHAP. 3
Âµsec (i.e., 2 msec) to handle the fault. If a program takes 60 sec to run, during which
time it gets 15,000 page faults, how long would it take to run if twice as much memory
were available?
43. A group of operating system designers for the Frugal Computer Company are thinking
about ways to reduce the amount of backing store needed in their new operating 
system. The project manager has just suggested not bothering to save the program text in
the swap area at all, but just page it in directly from the binary file whenever it is 
needed. Under what conditions, if any, does this idea work for the program text? Under
what conditions, if any, does it work for the data?
44. A machine-language instruction to load a 32-bit word into a register contains the 32-bit
address of the word to be loaded. What is the maximum number of page faults this
instruction can cause?
45. Explain the difference between internal fragmentation and external fragmentation.
Which one occurs in paging systems? Which one occurs in systems using pure 
segmentation?
46. When segmentation and paging are both being used, as in MULTICS, first the segment
descriptor must be looked up, then the page descriptor. Does the TLB also work this
way, with two lev els of lookup?
47. We consider a program which has the two segments shown below consisting of 
instructions in segment 0, and read/write data in segment 1. Segment 0 has read/execute 
protection, and segment 1 has just read/write protection. The memory system is a 
demandpaged virtual memory system with virtual addresses that have a 4-bit page number, and
a 10-bit offset. The page tables and protection are as follows (all numbers in the table
are in decimal):

For each of the following cases, either give the real (actual) memory address which
results from dynamic address translation or identify the type of fault which occurs
(either page or protection fault).
(a) Fetch from segment 1, page 1, offset 3
(b) Store into segment 0, page 0, offset 16
(c) Fetch from segment 1, page 4, offset 28
(d) Jump to location in segment 1, page 3, offset 32
