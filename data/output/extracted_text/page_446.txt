character telling how to do the rasterization. For example, both serifs on the top of
the letter T should be identical, something that might not otherwise be the case due
to roundoff error. Hints improve the final appearance.
Touch Screens
More and more the screen is used as an input device also. Especially on 
smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices, it is convenient to tap and swipe away
at the screen with your finger (or a stylus). The user experience is different and
more intuitive than with a mouse-like device, since the user interacts directly with
the objects on the screen. Research has shown that even orangutans are capable of
operating touch-based devices.
A touch device is not necessarily a screen. Touch devices fall into two 
categories: opaque and transparent. A typical opaque touch device is the trackpad on a
notebook computer, as discussed earlier. An example of a transparent device is the
touch screen on a smartphone or tablet. In this section, however, we limit ourselves
to touch screens.
Like many things that have come into fashion in the computer industry, touch
screens are not exactly new. As early as 1965, E.A. Johnson of the British Royal
Radar Establishment described a (capacitive) touch display that, while crude,
served as precursor of the displays we find today. Most modern touch screens are
either resistive or capacitive.
Resistive screens have a flexible plastic surface on top. The plastic in itself is
nothing too special, except that is more scratch resistant than your garden variety
