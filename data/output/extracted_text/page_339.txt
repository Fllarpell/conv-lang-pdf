may also have other internal files that should not be backed up, so the dumping
program needs to be aware of them.
The main advantages of physical dumping are simplicity and great speed 
(basically, it can run at the speed of the disk). The main disadvantages are the inability
to skip selected directories, make incremental dumps, and restore individual files
upon request. For these reasons, most installations make logical dumps.
A logical dump starts at one or more specified directories and recursively
dumps all files and directories found there that have changed since some given
base date (e.g., the last backup for an incremental dump or system installation for a
full dump). Thus, in a logical dump, the dump disk gets a series of carefully 
identified directories and files, which makes it easy to restore a specific file or directory
upon request.
Since logical dumping is the most common form, let us examine a common
algorithm in detail using the example of Fig. 4-27 to guide us. Most UNIX systems
use this algorithm. In the figure, we see a file tree with directories (squares) and
files (circles). The shaded items have been modified since the base date and thus
need to be dumped. The unshaded ones do not need to be dumped.

Figure 4-27. A file system to be dumped. The squares are directories and the 
circles are files. The shaded items have been modified since the last dump. Each
directory and file is labeled by its i-node number.
This algorithm also dumps all directories (even unmodified ones) that lie on
the path to a modified file or directory for two reasons. The first reason is to make
it possible to restore the dumped files and directories to a fresh file system on a 
different computer. In this way, the dump and restore programs can be used to 
transport entire file systems between computers.
