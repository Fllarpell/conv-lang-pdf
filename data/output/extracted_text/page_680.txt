miners. Moreover, carbon monoxide is odorless, so the miners might not even 
notice it. In the past, miners therefore brought canaries into the mine as biological
early warning systems. Any build up of toxic gases would kill the canary before
harming its owner. If your bird died, it was probably time to go up. Besides, the
canaries provide lovely audio while alive.
Modern computer systems still use (digital) canaries as early warning systems.
The idea is very simple. At places where the program makes a function call, the
compiler inserts code to save a random canary value on the stack, just below the
return address. Upon a return from the function, the compiler inserts code to check
the value of the canary. If the value changed, something is wrong. In that case, it is
better to hit the panic button and crash rather than continuing.
Av oiding Stack Canaries
Canaries work well against attacks like the one above, but many buffer 
overflows are still possible. For instance, consider the code snippet in Fig. 9-18. It uses
two new functions. The strcpy is a C library function to copy a string into a buffer,
while the strlen determines the length of a string.
01. void A (char *date) {
02. 
int len;
03. 
char B [128];
04. 
char logMsg [256];
05.
06. 
strcpy (logMsg, date);
/* first copy the string with the date in the log message */
07. 
len = str len (date); 
/* deter mine how many characters are in the date string */
08. 
gets (B); 
/* now get the actual message */
09. 
strcpy (logMsg+len, B);
/* and copy it after the date into logMessage */
10. 
writeLog (logMsg);
/* finally, write the log message to disk */
11. }
Figure 9-18. Skipping the stack canary: by modifying len first, the attack is able
to bypass the canary and modify the return address directly.
As we saw in the previous example, function A reads a log message from 
standard input, but this time it explicitly prepends it with the current date (provided as
a string argument to function A). First, it copies the date into the log message
(line 6). A date string may have different length, depending on the day of the week,
the month, etc. For instance, Friday has 5 letters, but Saturday 8. Same thing for
the months. So, the second thing it does is determine how many characters are in
the date string (line 7). Then it gets the user input (line 8) and copies it into the log
message, starting just after the date string. It does this by specifying the destination
