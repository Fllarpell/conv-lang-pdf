Figure 5-20. An illustration of cylinder skew.
should be at least 40 sectors, rather than the three sectors shown in Fig. 5-20. It is
worth mentioning that switching between heads also takes a finite time, so there is
head skew as well as cylinder skew, but head skew is not very large, usually much
less than one sector time.
As a result of the low-level formatting, disk capacity is reduced, depending on
the sizes of the preamble, intersector gap, and ECC, as well as the number of spare
sectors reserved. Often the formatted capacity is 20% lower than the unformatted
capacity. The spare sectors do not count toward the formatted capacity, so all disks
of a given type have exactly the same capacity when shipped, independent of how
many bad sectors they actually have (if the number of bad sectors exceeds the
number of spares, the drive will be rejected and not shipped).
There is considerable confusion about disk capacity because some 
manufacturers advertised the unformatted capacity to make their drives look larger than they
in reality are. For example, let us consider a drive whose unformatted capacity is
20 × 1012 bytes. This might be sold as a 20-TB disk. However, after formatting,
possibly only 17 × 1012 bytes are available for data. To add to the confusion, the
operating system may report this capacity as 15 TB, not 17 TB, because software
considers a memory of 1 TB to be 240 (1.099.511.627.776) bytes, not 1012
(1,000,000,000,000) bytes. It would be better if this were reported as 15 TiB.
