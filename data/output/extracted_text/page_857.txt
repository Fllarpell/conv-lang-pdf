Content Providers
Our last application component, the content provider, is the primary 
mechanism that applications use to exchange data with each other. All interactions with a
content provider are through URIs using a content: scheme; the authority of the
URI is used to find the correct content-provider implementation to interact with.
For example, in our email application from Fig. 10-51, the content provider
specifies that its authority is com.example.email.provider.email. Thus, URIs 
operating on this content provider would start with
content://com.example.email.provider.email/
The suffix to that URI is interpreted by the provider itself to determine what data
within it is being accessed. In the example here, a common convention would be
that the URI
content://com.example.email.provider.email/messages
means the list of all email messages, while
content://com.example.email.provider.email/messages/1
provides access to a single message at key number 1.
To interact with a content provider, applications always go through a system
API called ContentResolver, where most methods have an initial URI argument
indicating the data to operate on. One of the most often used ContentResolver
methods is query, which performs a database query on a given URI and returns a
