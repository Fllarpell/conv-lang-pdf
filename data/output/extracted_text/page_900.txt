CASE STUDY 2: WINDOWS 11
Windows is a modern operating system that runs on consumer PCs, laptops,
tablets, and phones as well as business desktop PCs, workstations, and enterprise
servers. Windows is also the operating system used in Microsoft’s Xbox gaming
system, the Hololens mixed-reality device, and Azure cloud computing 
infrastructure. The most recent version is Windows 11, released in 2021. In this chapter, we
will examine various aspects of Windows, starting with a brief history, then 
moving on to its architecture. After this, we will look at processes, memory 
management, caching, I/O, the file system, power management, and finally, security.
11.1 HISTORY OF WINDOWS THROUGH WINDOWS 11
Microsoft’s dev elopment of the Windows operating system for PC-based 
computers as well as servers can be divided into four eras: MS-DOS, MS-DOS-based
Windows, NT-based Windows, and Modern Windows. Technically, each of
these systems is substantially different from the others. Each was dominant during
different decades in the history of the personal computer. Figure 11-1 shows the
dates of the major Microsoft operating system releases for desktop computers.
Below we will briefly sketch each of the eras shown in the table.
