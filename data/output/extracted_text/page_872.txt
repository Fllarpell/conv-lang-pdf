Androidâ€™s system settings include a user interface for selecting input methods.
This interface shows all available input methods of the currently installed 
applications and whether or not they are enabled. If users want to use a new input method
after they hav e installed the application, they must go to this system settings 
interface and enable it. When doing that, the system can also inform the user of the
kinds of things this will allow the application to do.
Even once an application is enabled as an input method, Android uses 
finegrained access-control techniques to limit its impact. For example, only the 
application that is being used as the current input method can actually have any special
interaction; if the user has enabled multiple input methods (such as a soft keyboard
and voice input), only the one that is currently in active use will have those features
available in its sandbox. Even the current input method is restricted in what it can
do, through additional policies such as only allowing it to interact with the window
that currently has input focus.
SELinux and Defense in Depth
A robust security architecture is important: one where access to data is 
minimized, the architecture is easy to understand so that it is less likely for bugs to be
introduced during development, and changes that violate the intended security
guarantees are easy to identify. Even in the best design, however, bugs will always
