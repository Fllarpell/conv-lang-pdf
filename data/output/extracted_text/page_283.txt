o = 400, will this page be removed? What about if o = 1000?
33. Suppose that the WSClock page replacement algorithm uses a o of two ticks, and the
system state is the following:

where the three flag bits V, R, and M stand for Valid, Referenced, and Modified,
respectively.
(a) If a clock interrupt occurs at tick 10, show the contents of the new table entries.
Explain. (You can omit entries that are unchanged.)
(b) Suppose that instead of a clock interrupt, a page fault occurs at tick 10 due to a read
request to page 4. Show the contents of the new table entries. Explain. (You can
omit entries that are unchanged.)
34. A student has claimed that ‘‘in the abstract, the basic page replacement algorithms
(FIFO, LRU, optimal) are identical except for the attribute used for selecting the page
to be replaced.’’
(a) What is that attribute for the FIFO algorithm? LRU algorithm? Optimal algorithm?
(b) Give the generic algorithm for these page replacement algorithms.
35. How long does it take to load a 64-KB program from a disk whose average seek time is
5 msec, whose rotation time is 5 msec, and whose tracks hold 1 MB
(a) for a 2-KB page size?
(b) for a 4-KB page size?
The pages are spread randomly around the disk and the number of cylinders is so large
that the chance of two pages being on the same cylinder is negligible.
36. A computer has four page frames. The time of loading, time of last access, and the R
and M bits for each page are as shown below (the times are in clock ticks):

(a) Which page will NRU replace?
(b) Which page will FIFO replace?
(c) Which page will LRU replace?
(d) Which page will second chance replace?
37. Suppose that two processes A and B share a page that is not in memory. If process A
