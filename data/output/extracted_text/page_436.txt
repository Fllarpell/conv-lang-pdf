tend to be short-lived and do not survive workstation reboots. Typical resources
include windows, fonts, colormaps (color palettes), pixmaps (bitmaps), cursors,
and graphic contexts. The latter are used to associate properties with windows and
are similar in concept to device contexts in Windows.
A rough, incomplete skeleton of an X program is shown in Fig. 5-34. It begins
by including some required headers and then declaring some variables. It then
connects to the X server specified as the parameter to XOpenDisplay. Then it 
allocates a window resource and stores a handle to it in win. In practice, some 
initialization would happen here. After that it tells the window manager that the new
window exists so the window manager can manage it.

Display disp; 
/* ser ver identifier */
Window win; 
/* window identifier */

XEvent event; 
/* storage for one event */
int running = 1;
disp = XOpenDisplay("display name"); 
/* connect to the X server */
win = XCreateSimpleWindow(disp, ... ); /* allocate memory for new window */
XSetStandardProper ties(disp, ...); 
/* announces window to window mgr */
gc = XCreateGC(disp, win, 0, 0);
/* create graphic context */
XSelectInput(disp, win, ButtonPressMask | KeyPressMask | ExposureMask);
XMapRaised(disp, win); 
/* display window; send Expose event */
while (running) {
XNextEvent(disp, &ev ent); 
/* get next event */
switch (event.type) {
case Expose:
...; 
break;
/* repaint window */
case ButtonPress:

/* process mouse click */
case Keypress:

/* process keyboard input */
}
}
XFreeGC(disp, gc); 
/* release graphic context */
XDestroyWindow(disp, win); 
/* deallocate windowâ€™s memor y space */
XCloseDisplay(disp); 
/* tear down networ k connection */
}
Figure 5-34. A skeleton of an X Window application program.
The call to XCreateGC creates a graphic context in which properties of the
window are stored. In a more complete program, they might be initialized here.
The next statement, the call to XSelectInput, tells the X server which events the
