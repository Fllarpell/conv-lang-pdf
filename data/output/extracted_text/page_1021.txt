  Master File Table
Figure 11-44. The NTFS master file table.
Record 1 is a duplicate of the early portion of the MFT file. This information is
so precious that having a second copy can be critical in the event one of the first
blocks of the MFT ever becomes unreadable. Record 2 is the log file. When 
structural changes are made to the file system, such as adding a new directory or 
removing an existing one, the action is logged here before it is performed, in order to
increase the chance of correct recovery in the event of a failure during the 
operation, such as a system crash. Changes to file attributes are also logged here. In fact,
the only changes not logged here are changes to user data. Record 3 contains 
information about the volume, such as its size, label, and version.
As mentioned above, each MFT record contains a sequence of (attribute 
header, value) pairs. The $AttrDef file is where the attributes are defined. Information
about this file is in MFT record 4. Next comes the root directory, which itself is a
file and can grow to arbitrary length. It is described by MFT record 5.
Free space on the volume is kept track of with a bitmap. The bitmap is itself a
file, and its attributes and disk addresses are given in MFT record 6. The next MFT
record points to the bootstrap loader file. Record 8 is used to link all the bad blocks
together to make sure they nev er occur in a file. Record 9 contains the security
information. Record 10 is used for case mapping. For the Latin letters A-Z case
mapping is obvious (at least for people who speak Latin). Case mapping for other
languages, such as Greek, Armenian, or Georgian (the country, not the state), is
less obvious to Latin speakers, so this file tells how to do it. Finally, record 11 is a
