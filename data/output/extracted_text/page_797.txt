other will have to use an absolute path name to refer to it (or change the working
directory). If this is long enough, it may become irritating to have to keep typing
it. Linux provides a solution by allowing users to make a new directory entry that
points to an existing file. Such an entry is called a link.
As an example, consider the situation of Fig. 10-24(a). Aron and Nathan are
working together on a project, and each of them needs access to the other’s files. If
Aron has /usr/aron as his working directory, he can refer to the file x in Nathan’s
directory as /usr/nathan/x. Alternatively, Aron can create a new entry in his 
directory, as shown in Fig. 10-24(b), after which he can use x to mean /usr/nathan/x.

In the example just discussed, we suggested that before linking, the only way
for Aron to refer to Nathan’s file x was by using its absolute path. Actually, this is
not really true. When a directory is created, two entries, . and .., are automatically
made in it. The former refers to the working directory itself. The latter refers to the
directory’s parent, that is, the directory in which it itself is listed. Thus from
/usr/aron, another path to Nathan’s file x is .. /nathan/x .
In addition to regular files, Linux also supports character special files and
block special files. Character special files are used to model serial I/O devices,
such as keyboards and printers. Opening and reading from /dev/tty reads from the
keyboard; opening and writing to /dev/lp writes to the printer. Block special files,
often with names like /dev/hd1, can be used to read and write raw disk partitions
without regard to the file system. Thus, a seek to byte k followed by a read will
begin reading from the kth byte on the corresponding partition, completely 
ignoring the i-node and file structure. Raw block devices are used for paging and 
swapping by programs that lay down file systems (e.g., mkfs), and by programs that fix
sick file systems (e.g., fsck), for example.
Many computers have two or more disks. On mainframes at banks, for 
example, it is frequently necessary to have 100 or more disks on a single machine, in
