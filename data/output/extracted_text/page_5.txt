Problem 4 solution: 
The “Mammoth” tank’s electric motor has the maximum power of 5 MW. The tank 
can move (with no sliding) up a hill, which makes the angle of 29o with the 
horizontal, at maximum speed of 37 km/h. What is the mass (in tons, round to 2 
decimal places) of the tank?  
 
Given: 
𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥= 5 ⋅106𝑊 
𝛼= 29° 
𝑉𝑚= 37𝑘𝑚ℎ=
⁄
10.28𝑚/𝑠 
 
Find: 
𝑚 
 
 
Solution: 
Express power in terms of force and velocity: 
𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥= 𝐹⋅𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 
𝐹= 𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
 
Set up the force equation based on the incline: 
(1) 
 
𝐹= 𝑚⋅𝑔⋅sin (𝑎) 
(2) 
Combine [Eq. 2] and [Eq. 3] to solve for 𝒎: 
𝑚=
𝑃𝑚
𝑔⋅sin (𝑎) ⋅𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
=
5 ⋅106
9.8 ⋅sin (29°) ⋅10.28 ≈102.39 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠 
(3) 
 
Answer: 𝑚= 102.39 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠
