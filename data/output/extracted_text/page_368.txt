personal computers, it often takes the form of a chip on the motherboard or a
printed circuit card that can be inserted into a (PCIe) expansion slot. The 
mechanical component is the device itself. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 1-6.
The controller card usually has a connector on it, into which a cable leading to
the device itself can be plugged. Many controllers can handle two, four, eight, or
ev en more identical devices. If the interface between the controller and device is a
standard interface, either an official ANSI, IEEE, or ISO standard or a de facto
one, then companies can make controllers or devices that fit that interface. Many
companies, for example, make disk drives that match the SATA, SCSI, USB, or
Thunderbolt, interfaces.
The interface between the controller and the device is often a very low-level
one. A disk, for example, might have 3,000,000 tracks, each formatted with 
between 200 and 500 sectors of 4,096 bytes each. What actually comes off the drive,
however, is a serial bit stream, starting with a preamble, then followed by the
8 × 4, 096 = 32, 768 bits in a sector, and finally a checksum, or ECC 
(Error-Correcting Code). The preamble is written when the disk is formatted and contains
the cylinder and sector number, the sector size, and similar data, as well as 
synchronization information.
The controller’s job is to convert the serial bit stream into a block of bytes and
perform any error correction that is necessary. The block of bytes is typically first
