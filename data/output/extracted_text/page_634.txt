SECURITY
Many companies possess valuable information they want to guard closely.
Among many things, this information can be technical (e.g., a new chip design or
software), commercial (e.g., studies of the competition or marketing plans), 
financial (e.g., plans for a stock offering), or legal (e.g., documents about a potential
merger or takeover). Most of this information is stored on computers. Home 
computers increasingly have valuable data on them, too. Many people keep their 
financial information, including tax returns and credit card numbers, on their computer.
Love letters have gone digital. And disks (by which we also mean SSDs in this
chapter) these days are full of important photos, videos, and movies.
As more and more of this information is stored in computer systems, the need
to protect it is becoming increasingly important. Guarding the information against
unauthorized usage is therefore a major concern of all operating systems. 
Unfortunately, it is also becoming increasingly difficult due to the widespread 
acceptance of system bloat (and the accompanying bugs) as a normal phenomenon. In
this chapter, we will examine computer security as it applies to operating systems.
The issues relating to operating system security have changed radically in the
past few decades. Up until the early 1990s, few people had a computer at home
and most computing was done at companies, universities, and other organizations
on multiuser computers ranging from large mainframes to minicomputers. Nearly
all of these machines were isolated, not connected to any networks. As a 
consequence of this situation security was almost entirely focused on how to keep the
users out of each otherâ€™s hair. If Elinor and Carolyn were both registered users of
