cumstances in which diagonal trajectories are also possible?
21. Can the resource trajectory scheme of Fig. 6-11 also be used to illustrate the problem
of deadlocks with three processes and three resources? How or why not?
22. In theory, resource trajectory graphs could be used to avoid deadlocks. By clever
scheduling, the operating system could avoid unsafe regions. Is there a practical way
of actually doing this?
23. Can a system be in a state that is neither deadlocked nor safe? If so, give an example.
If not, prove that all states are either deadlocked or safe.
24. Take a careful look at Fig. 6-14(b). If D asks for one more unit, does this lead to a safe
state or an unsafe one? What if the request came from C instead of D?
25. A system has two processes and three identical resources. Each process needs a 
maximum of two resources. Is deadlock possible? Explain your answer.
26. Consider the previous problem again, but now with p processes each needing a 
maximum of m resources and a total of r resources available. What condition must hold to
make the system deadlock free?
27. Suppose that process A in Fig. 6-15 requests the last tape drive. Does this action lead
to a deadlock?
28. A computer has X tape drives, with n processes competing for them. Each process may
need up to m drives. How many tape drives should the system have to guarantee that it
is deadlock free?
29. The bankerâ€™s algorithm is being run in a system with m resource classes and n 
processes. In the limit of large m and n, the number of operations that must be performed
to check a state for safety is proportional to manb. What are the values of a and b?
30. A system has four processes and fiv e allocatable resources. The current allocation and
maximum needs are as follows:
Allocated 
Maximum
Available
Process A
1 0 2 1 1  
1 1 2 1 3  
0 0 x 1 1
Process B
2 0 1 1 0  
2 2 2 1 0
Process C
1 1 0 1 0  
2 1 3 1 0
Process D
1 1 1 1 0  
1 1 2 2 1
What is the smallest value of x for which this is a safe state?
31. One way to eliminate circular wait is to have rule saying that a process is entitled only
to a single resource at any moment. Give an example to show that this restriction is
unacceptable in many cases.
32. Tw o processes, A and B, each need three records, 1, 2, and 3, in a database. If A asks
for them in the order 1, 2, 3, and B asks for them in the same order, deadlock is not
possible. However, if B asks for them in the order 3, 2, 1, then deadlock is possible.
With three resources, there are 3! or six possible combinations in which each process
can request them. What fraction of the combinations is sure to be deadlock free?
33. A distributed system using mailboxes has two IPC primitives, send and receive. The
