people prefer to use backspace, and others prefer DEL. Similarly, to erase the
entire line just typed, many conventions abound. Traditionally @ was used, but
with the spread of email (which uses @ within email address), many systems have
adopted CTRL-U or some other character. Likewise, to interrupt the running 
program, some special key must be hit. Here, too, different people have different 
preferences. CTRL-C is a common choice, but it is not universal.
Rather than making a choice and forcing everyone to use it, Linux allows all
these special functions and many others to be customized by the user. A special
system call is generally provided for setting these options. This system call also
handles tab expansion, enabling and disabling of character echoing, conversion
between carriage return and line feed, and similar items. The system call is not 
permitted on regular files or block special files.
10.5.2 Networking
Another example of I/O is networking, as pioneered by Berkeley UNIX and
taken over by Linux more or less verbatim. The key concept in the Berkeley design
is the socket. Sockets are analogous to mailboxes and telephone wall sockets in
that they allow users to interface to the network, just as mailboxes allow people to
interface to the postal system and telephone wall sockets allow them to plug in
telephones and connect to the telephone system. The socketsâ€™ position is shown in
Fig. 10-19.

Figure 10-19. The uses of sockets for networking.
Sockets can be created and destroyed dynamically. Creating a socket returns a file
descriptor, which is needed for establishing a connection, reading data, writing
data, and releasing the connection.
Each socket supports a particular type of networking, specified when the
socket is created. The most common types are as follows:
