Figure 4-24. (a) Storing the free list on a linked list. (b) A bitmap.
allocated blocks by 0s (or vice versa). For our example 1-TB disk, we need 1 
billion bits for the map, which requires around 130,000 1-KB blocks to store. It is
not surprising that the bitmap requires less space, since it uses 1 bit per block, vs.
32 bits in the linked-list model. Only if the disk is nearly full (i.e., has few free
blocks) will the linked-list scheme require fewer blocks than the bitmap.
If free blocks tend to come in long runs of consecutive blocks, the free-list 
system can be modified to keep track of runs of blocks rather than single blocks. An
8-, 16-, or 32-bit count could be associated with each block giving the number of
consecutive free blocks. In the best case, a basically empty disk could be 
represented by two numbers: the address of the first free block followed by the count of
free blocks. On the other hand, if the disk becomes severely fragmented, keeping
track of runs is less efficient than keeping track of individual blocks because not
only must the address be stored, but also the count.
This issue illustrates a problem operating system designers often have. There
are multiple data structures and algorithms that can be used to solve a problem, but
choosing the best one requires data that the designers do not have and will not have
until the system is deployed and heavily used. And even then, the data may not be
available. For instance, while we may measure the file size distribution and disk
usage in one or two environments, we have little idea if these numbers are 
representative of home computers, corporate computers, government computers, not to
mention tablets and smartphones, and others.
