MEMORY MANAGEMENT

once (taking turns, if there is only one CPU). On personal computers, it is 
common to have sev eral programs open at once (a word processor, an email program, a
Web browser), one of them having the current focus, but the others being 
reactivated at the click of a mouse. Since this situation is difficult to achieve when there
is no abstraction from physical memory, something had to be done.
3.2.1 The Notion of an Address Space
Tw o problems have to be solved to allow multiple applications to be in 
memory at the same time without interfering with each other: protection and relocation.
We looked at a primitive solution to the former used on the IBM 360: label chunks
of memory with a protection key and compare the key of the executing process to
that of every memory word fetched. However, this approach by itself does not
solve the latter problem, although it can be solved by relocating programs as they
are loaded, but this is a slow and complicated solution.
A better solution is to invent a new abstraction for memory: the address space.
Just as the process concept creates a kind of abstract CPU to run programs, the
address space creates a kind of abstract memory for programs to use. An address
space is the set of addresses that a process can use to address memory. Each 
process has its own address space, independent of those of other processes (except in
some special circumstances where processes want to share their address spaces).
The concept of an address space is very general and occurs in many contexts.
Consider telephone numbers. In the United States and many other countries, a
local telephone number is usually a 7-digit number. The address space for 
telephone numbers thus runs from 0,000,000 to 9,999,999, although some numbers,
such as those beginning with 000 are not used. The address space for I/O ports on
the x86 runs from 0 to 16383. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, so their address
space runs from 0 to 232 < 1 (again, with some reserved numbers).
Address spaces do not have to be numeric. The set of .com Internet domains is
also an address space. This address space consists of all the strings of length 2 to
63 characters that can be made using letters, numbers, and hyphens, followed by
.com. By now you should get the idea. It is fairly simple.
Somewhat harder is how to giv e each program its own address space, so
address 28 in one program means a different physical location than address 28 in
another program. Below we will discuss a simple way that used to be common but
has fallen into disuse due to the ability to put much more complicated (and better)
schemes on modern CPU chips.
Base and Limit Registers
This simple solution uses a particularly simple version of dynamic relocation.
What it does is map each process’ address space onto a different part of physical
memory in a simple way. The classical solution, which was used on machines
ranging from the CDC 6600 (the world’s first supercomputer) to the Intel 8088 (the
