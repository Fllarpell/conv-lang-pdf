faults on the shared page, the page table entry for process A must be updated once the
page is read into memory.
(a) Under what conditions should the page table update for process B be delayed even
though the handling of process A’s page fault will bring the shared page into 
memory? Explain.
(b) What is the potential cost of delaying the page table update?
38. Consider the following two-dimensional array:
int X[64][64];
Suppose that a system has four page frames and each frame is 128 words (an integer
occupies one word). Programs that manipulate the X array fit into exactly one page
and always occupy page 0. The data are swapped in and out of the other three frames.
The X array is stored in row-major order (i.e., X[0][1] follows X[0][0] in memory).
Which of the two code fragments shown below will generate the lowest number of
page faults? Explain and compute the total number of page faults.
Fr agment A
for (int j = 0; j < 64; j++)
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) X[i][j] = 0;
Fr agment B
for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++)
for (int j = 0; j < 64; j++) X[i][j] = 0;
39. You hav e been hired by a cloud computing company that deploys thousands of servers
at each of its data centers. They hav e recently heard that it would be worthwhile to
handle a page fault at server A by reading the page from the RAM memory of some
other server rather than its local disk drive.
(a) How could that be done?
(b) Under what conditions would the approach be worthwhile? Be feasible?
40. One of the first timesharing machines, the DEC PDP-1, had a (core) memory of 4K
18-bit words. It held one process at a time in its memory. When the scheduler decided
to run another process, the process in memory was written to a paging drum, with 4K
18-bit words around the circumference of the drum. The drum could start writing (or
reading) at any word, rather than only at word 0. Why do you suppose this drum was
chosen?
41. A computer provides each process with 65,536 bytes of address space divided into
pages of 4096 bytes each. A particular program has a text size of 32,768 bytes, a data
size of 16,386 bytes, and a stack size of 15,870 bytes. Will this program fit in the
machine’s address space? Suppose that instead of 4096 bytes, the page size were 512
bytes, would it then fit? Each page must contain either text, data, or stack, not a 
mixture of two or three of them.
42. It has been observed that the number of instructions executed between page faults is
directly proportional to the number of page frames allocated to a program. If the 
available memory is doubled, the mean interval between page faults is also doubled. 
Suppose that a normal instruction takes 1 microsec, but if a page fault occurs, it takes 2001
