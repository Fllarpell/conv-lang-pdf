SECURITY 
CHAP. 9
8. Represent the ownerships and permissions shown in this UNIX directory listing as a
protection matrix. (Note: asw is a member of two groups: users and devel; gmw is a
member only of users.) Treat each of the two users and two groups as a domain, so
that the matrix has four rows (one per domain) and four columns (one per file).

9. Express the permissions shown in the directory listing of the previous problem as
access-control lists.
10. Modify the ACL from the previous problem for one file to grant or deny an access that
cannot be expressed using the UNIX rwx system. Explain this modification.
11. Suppose there are three security levels, 1, 2, and 3. Objects A and B are at level 1, C
and D are at level 2, and E and F are at level 3. Processes 1 and 2 are at level 1, 3 and
4 are at level 2, and 5 and 6 are at level 3. For each of the following operations, 
specify whether they are permissible under Bell-LaPadula model, Biba model, or both.
(a) Process 1 writes object D
(b) Process 4 reads object A
(c) Process 3 reads object C
(d) Process 3 writes object C
(e) Process 2 reads object D
(f) Process 5 writes object F
(g) Process 6 reads object E
(h) Process 4 write object E
(i) Process 3 reads object F
12. In the Amoeba scheme for protecting capabilities, a user can ask the server to produce
a new capability with fewer rights, which can then be given to a friend. What happens
if the friend asks the server to remove even more rights so that the friend can give it to
someone else?
13. In Fig. 9-11, there is no arrow from process B to object 1. Would such an arrow be
allowed? If not, what rule would it violate?
14. If process-to-process messages were allowed in Fig. 9-11, what rules would apply to
them? For process B in particular, to which processes could it send messages and
which not?
15. Break the following monoalphabetic cipher. The plaintext, consisting of letters only, is
a well-known excerpt from a poem by Lewis Carroll.
