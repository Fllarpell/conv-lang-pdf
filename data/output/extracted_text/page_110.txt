1.12 SUMMARY
Operating systems can be viewed from two viewpoints: resource managers and
extended machines. In the resource-manager view, the operating systemâ€™s job is to
manage the different parts of the system efficiently. In the extended-machine view,
the system provides the users with abstractions that are more convenient to use
than the actual machine. These include processes, address spaces, and files.
Operating systems have a long history, starting from the days when they
replaced the operator, to modern multiprogramming systems. Highlights include
early batch systems, multiprogramming systems, and personal computer systems.
Since operating systems interact closely with the hardware, some knowledge
of computer hardware is useful to understanding them. Computers are built up of
processors, memories, and I/O devices. These parts are connected by buses.
Operating systems can be structured as monolithic, layered, 
microkernel/client-server, virtual machine, or exokernel/unikernel systems. Regardless, the basic
concepts on which they are built are processes, memory management, I/O 
management, the file system, and security. The main interface of an operating system is
the set of system calls that it can handle. These tell us what it really does.
PROBLEMS
1. What are the two main functions of an operating system?
2. In Sec. 1.4, nine different types of operating systems are described. Give a list of
