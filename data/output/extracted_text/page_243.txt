not that important. Of course, using a 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit counter provides
more history but the cost is more memory to store it. Usually 8 bits does the job
just fine.
3.4.8 The Working Set Page Replacement Algorithm
In the purest form of paging, processes are started up with none of their pages
in memory. As soon as the CPU tries to fetch the first instruction, it gets a page
fault, causing the operating system to bring in the page containing the first 
instruction. Other page faults for global variables and the stack usually follow quickly.
After a while, the process has most of the pages it needs and settles down to run
with relatively few page faults. This strategy is called demand paging because
pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance.
Of course, it is easy enough to write a test program that systematically reads all
the pages in a large address space, causing so many page faults that there is not
enough memory to hold them all. Fortunately, most processes do not work this
way. They exhibit a locality of reference, meaning that during any phase of
execution, the process references only a relatively small fraction of its pages. Each
pass of a multipass compiler, for example, references only a fraction of all the
pages, and a different fraction at that.
The set of pages that a process is currently using is its working set (Denning,
1968a; and Denning, 1980). If the entire working set is in memory, the process
