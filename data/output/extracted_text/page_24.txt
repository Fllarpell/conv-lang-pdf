PREFACE
The fifth edition of this book differs from the fourth edition in many ways.
There are large numbers of small changes everywhere to bring the material up to
date as operating systems are not standing still. For example, where the previous
edition focused almost exclusively on magnetic hard disks for storage, this time we
give the flash-based Solid State Drives (SSDs) the attention that befits their 
popularity. The chapter on Windows 8.1 has been replaced entirely by a chapter on the
new Windows 11. We hav e rewritten much of the security chapter, with more
focus on topics that are directly relevant for operating systems (and exciting new
attacks and defenses), while reducing the discussion of cryptography and 
steganography. Here is a chapter-by-chapter rundown of the changes.
•
Chapter 1 has been heavily modified and updated in many places, but
with the exception of dropping the description of CD-ROMs and
DVDs in favor of modern storage solutions such as SSDs and 
persistent memory, no major sections have been added or deleted.
•
In Chapter 2, we significantly expanded the discussion of event-driven
servers and included an extensive example with pseudo code. We gav e
priority inversion its own section where we also discussed ways to deal
with the problem. We reordered some of the sections to clarify the 
discussion. For instance, we now discuss the readers-writers problem
