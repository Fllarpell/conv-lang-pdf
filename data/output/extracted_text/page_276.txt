Figure 3-37. A simplified version of the MULTICS TLB. The existence of two
page sizes made the actual TLB more complicated.
The addresses of the 16 most recently referenced pages were kept in the TLB.
Programs whose working set was smaller than the TLB size came to equilibrium
with the addresses of the entire working set in the TLB and therefore ran
efficiently; otherwise, there were TLB faults.
