coresponding service in the system server. To accomplish this, at boot time the
system server publishes each service under a well-defined name in the service

Figure 10-40. Publishing and interacting with system services.
Once the PackageManager has connected with its system service, it can make
calls on it.
Most application calls to PackageManager are implemented as
interprocess communication using Androidâ€™s Binder IPC mechanism, in this case
making calls to the PackageManagerService implementation in the system server.
The implementation of PackageManagerService arbitrates interactions across all
client applications and maintains state that will be needed by multiple applications.

For the most part, Android includes a stock Linux kernel providing standard
Linux features. Most of the interesting aspects of Android as an operating system
are in how those existing Linux features are used. There are also, however, sev eral
