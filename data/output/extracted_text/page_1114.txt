costs $100,000 per year (including overhead, such as computers, office space, 
secretarial support, and management overhead). Do you believe this answer? If not, what
might be wrong with it?
26. As memory gets cheaper and cheaper, one could imagine a computer with a big 
battery-backed-up RAM instead of a hard disk. At current prices, how much would a
low-end RAM-only PC cost? Assume that a 100-GB RAM-disk is sufficient for a 
lowend machine. Is this machine likely to be competitive?
27. Name some features of a conventional operating system that are not needed in an
embedded system used inside an appliance.
28. Write a procedure in C to do a double-precision addition on two giv en parameters.
Write the procedure using conditional compilation in such a way that it works on
16-bit machines and also on 32-bit machines.
29. Write programs that enter randomly generated short strings into an array and then can
search the array for a given string using (a) a simple linear search (brute force), and (b)
a more sophisticated method of your choice. Recompile your programs for array sizes
ranging from small to as large as you can handle on your system. Evaluate the 
performance of both approaches. Where is the break-even point?
30. Write a program to simulate an in-memory file system.
