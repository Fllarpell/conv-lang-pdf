creates a file called abc with the protection bits taken from mode. These bits 
determine which users may access the file and how. They will be described later.
The creat call not only creates a new file, but also opens it for writing. To
allow subsequent system calls to access the file, a successful creat returns a small
nonnegative integer called a file descriptor, fd in the example above. If a creat is
done on an existing file, that file is truncated to length 0 and its contents are 
discarded. Additionally, files can also be created using the open call with appropriate
arguments.
Now let us continue looking at the main file-system calls, which are listed in
Fig. 10-27. To read or write an existing file, the file must first be opened by calling
open or creat. This call specifies the file name to be opened and how it is to be
opened: for reading, writing, or both. Various options can be specified as well.
Like creat, the call to open returns a file descriptor that can be used for reading or
writing. Afterward, the file can be closed by close, which makes the file descriptor
available for reuse on a subsequent creat or open. Both the creat and open calls
always return the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently in use.
When a program starts executing in the standard way, file descriptors 0, 1, and
2 are already opened for standard input, standard output, and standard error,
respectively. In this way, a filter, such as the sort program, can just read its input
from file descriptor 0 and write its output to file descriptor 1, without having to
know what files they are. This mechanism works because the shell arranges for
these values to refer to the correct (redirected) files before the program is started.
