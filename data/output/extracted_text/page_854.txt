Services
A service has two distinct identities:
1. It can be a self-contained long-running background operation. 
Common examples of using services in this way are performing 
background music playback, maintaining an active network connection
(such as with an IRC server) while the user is in other applications,
downloading or uploading data in the background, etc.
2. It can serve as a connection point for other applications or the system
to perform rich interaction with the application. This can be used by
applications to provide secure APIs for other applications, such as to
perform image or audio processing, provide a text to speech, etc.
The example email manifest shown in Fig. 10-51 contains a service that is used
to perform synchronization of the userâ€™s mailbox. A common implementation
would schedule the service to run at a regular interval, such as every 15 minutes,
starting the service when it is time to run, and stopping itself when done.
This is a typical use of the first style of service, a long-running background
operation. Figure 10-57 shows the state of the system in this case, which is quite
simple. The activity manager has created a ServiceRecord to keep track of the
