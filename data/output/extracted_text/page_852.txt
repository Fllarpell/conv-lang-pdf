ComposeActivity here is participating in. If the user, while in the camera 
application, decides she wants to share a picture she took, our email application’s 
ComposeActivity is one of the sharing options she has. If it is selected, that activity will
be started and given the picture to be shared. (Later we will see how the camera
application is able to find the email application’s ComposeActivity.)
Performing that share option while in the activity state seen in Fig. 10-54 will
lead to the new state in Fig. 10-55. There are a number of important things to note:
1. The email app’s process must be started again, to run its 
ComposeActivity.
2. However, the old MailMainActivity is not started at this point, since it
is not needed. This reduces RAM use.
3. The camera’s task now has two records: the original 
CameraMainActivity we had just been in, and the new ComposeActivity that is now
displayed. To the user, these are still one cohesive task: it is the 
camera currently interacting with them to email a picture.
4. The new ComposeActivity is at the top, so it is resumed; the previous
CameraMainActivity is no longer at the top, so its state has been
saved. We can at this point safely quit its process if its RAM is 
needed elsewhere.
If you want to experiment yourself with this on Android, it should be noted
that starting in Android 5.0 a real share flow would result in the ComposeActivity
