READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
In the previous 12 chapters, we have touched upon a variety of topics. This
chapter is intended to aid readers interested in pursuing their study of operating
systems further. Section 13.1 is a list of suggested readings. Section 13.2 is an
alphabetical bibliography of all books and articles cited in this book.
In addition to the references given below, the ACM Symposium on Operating
System Principles (SOSP) held in odd-numbered years and the USENIX 
Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation (OSDI) held in even 
numbered years are good sources for ongoing work on operating systems. The ACM
SIGOPS Eurosys Conference, and USENIX Annual Technical Conference, held
annually are also sources of top-flight papers. Furthermore, the journals ACM
Tr ansactions on Computer Systems and ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,
often have relevant articles. Many other ACM, IEEE, and USENIX conferences
deal with specialized topics.
13.1 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING
In this section, we give some suggestions for further reading. Unlike the papers
cited in the sections entitled ‘‘RESEARCH ON ...’’ in the text, which are about 
current research, these references are mostly introductory or tutorial in nature. They
can, however, serve to present material in this book from a different perspective or
with a different emphasis.
