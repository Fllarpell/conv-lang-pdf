known as a rendezvous. It is easier to implement than a buffered message scheme
but is less flexible since the sender and receiver are forced to run in lockstep.
Message passing is commonly used in parallel programming systems. One
well-known message-passing system, for example, is MPI (Message-Passing
Interface). It is widely used for scientific computing. For more information about
it, see for example Gropp et al. (1994) and Snir et al. (1996).
2.4.9 Barriers
Our last synchronization mechanism is intended for groups of processes rather
than two-process producer-consumer type situations. Some applications are 
divided into phases and have the rule that no process may proceed into the next phase
until all processes are ready to proceed to the next phase. This behavior may be
achieved by placing a barrier at the end of each phase. When a process reaches
the barrier, it is blocked until all processes have reached the barrier. This allows
groups of processes to synchronize. Barrier operation is illustrated in Fig. 2-38.

processes but one blocked at the barrier. (c) When the last process arrives at the 
barrier, all of them are let through.
In Fig. 2-38(a) we see four processes approaching a barrier. What this means is
that they are just computing and have not reached the end of the current phase yet.
After a while, the first process finishes all the computing required of it during the
first phase. It then executes the barr ier primitive, generally by calling a library 
procedure. The process is then suspended. A little later, a second and then a third
process finish the first phase and also execute the barr ier primitive. This situation is
illustrated in Fig. 2-38(b). Finally, when the last process, C, hits the barrier, all the
processes are released, as shown in Fig. 2-38(c).
As an example of a problem requiring barriers, consider a common relaxation
problem in physics or engineering. There is typically a matrix that contains some
