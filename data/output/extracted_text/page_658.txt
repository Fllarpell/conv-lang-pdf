the system will carry out her request because it does not know that the state of
Fig. 9-10(b) is unauthorized.
It should now be clear that the set of all possible matrices can be partitioned
into two disjoint sets: the set of all authorized states and the set of all unauthorized
states. A question around which much theoretical research has revolved is this:
‘‘Given an initial authorized state and a set of commands, can it be proven that the
system can never reach an unauthorized state?’’
In effect, we are asking if the available mechanism (the protection commands)
is adequate to enforce some protection policy. Giv en this policy, some initial state
of the matrix, and the set of commands for modifying the matrix, what we would
like is a  way to prove that the system is secure. Such a proof turns out quite 
difficult to acquire; many general-purpose systems are not theoretically secure. 
Harrison et al. (1976) proved that in the case of an arbitrary configuration for an 
arbitrary protection system, security is theoretically undecidable. However, for a 
specific system, it may be possible to prove whether the system can ever move from
an authorized state to an unauthorized state. For more information, see Landwehr
(1981).
9.3.1 Multilevel Security
Most operating systems allow individual users to determine who may read and
write their files and other objects. This policy is called discretionary access 
control. In many environments this model works fine, but there are other 
environments where much tighter security is required, such as the military, corporate
patent departments, and hospitals. In the latter environments, the organization has
stated rules about who can see what, and these may not be modified by individual
soldiers, lawyers, or doctors, at least not without getting special permission from
the boss (and probably from the boss’ lawyers as well). These environments need
mandatory access controls to ensure that the stated security policies are enforced
by the system, in addition to the standard discretionary access controls. What these
