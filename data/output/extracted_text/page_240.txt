The operation of this algorithm, called second chance, is shown in Fig. 3-15.
In Fig. 3-15(a), we see pages A through H kept on a linked list and sorted by the
time they arrived in memory.

Figure 3-15. Operation of second chance. (a) Pages sorted in FIFO order.
(b) Page list if a page fault occurs at time 20 and A has its R bit set. The numbers
above the pages are their load times.
Suppose that a page fault occurs at time 20. The oldest page is A, which 
arrived at time 0, when the process started. If A has the R bit cleared, it is evicted
from memory, either by being written to nonvolatile storage (if it is dirty), or just
abandoned (if it is clean). On the other hand, if the R bit is set, A is put onto the
end of the list and its ‘‘load time’’ is reset to the current time (20). The R bit is also
cleared. The search for a suitable page continues with B.
What second chance is looking for is an old page that has not been referenced
in the most recent clock interval. If all the pages have been referenced, second
chance degenerates into pure FIFO. Specifically, imagine that all the pages in
Fig. 3-15(a) have their R bits set. One by one, the operating system moves the
pages to the end of the list, clearing the R bit each time it appends a page to the end
of the list. Eventually, it comes back to page A, which now has its R bit cleared. At
this point, A is evicted. Thus the algorithm always terminates.
3.4.5 The Clock Page Replacement Algorithm
Although second chance is a reasonable algorithm, it is unnecessarily 
inefficient because it is constantly moving pages around on its list. A better approach
is to keep all the page frames on a circular list in the form of a clock, as shown in
Fig. 3-16. The hand points to the oldest page.
When a page fault occurs, the page being pointed to by the hand is inspected.
If its R bit is 0, the page is evicted, the new page is inserted into the clock in its
place, and the hand is advanced one position. If R is 1, it is cleared and the hand is
advanced to the next page. This process is repeated until a page is found with
R = 0. Not surprisingly, this algorithm is called clock.
