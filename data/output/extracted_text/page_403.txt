To make things even worse, in the world of data communications, 1 Tbps
means 1,000,000,000,000 bits/sec because the prefix Tera really does mean 1012 (a
kilometer is 1000 meters, not 1024 meters, after all). Only with memory and disk
sizes do kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, and zetta mean 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260,
and 270, respectively.
To avoid confusion, some authors use the prefixes kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta,
exa, and zetta to mean 103, 106, 109, 1012, 1015, 1018, and 1021 respectively, while
using kibi, mebi, gibi, tebi, pebi, exbi, and zebi to mean 210, 220, 230, etc. 
However, the use of the ‘‘b’’ prefixes is relatively rare. Just in case you like really big
numbers, one yottabyte is 1024 and a yobibyte 280 bytes.
Formatting also affects performance. If a track on a 10,000-RPM disk has 300
sectors of 512 bytes each, it takes 6 msec to read the 153,600 bytes on the track for
a data rate of 25,600,000 bytes/sec or 24.4 MB/sec. It is not possible to go faster
than this, no matter what kind of interface is present, even if it is a SAT A interface
at 6 GB/sec.
Actually reading continuously at this rate requires a large buffer in the 
controller. Consider, for example, a controller with a one-sector buffer that has been
given a command to read two consecutive sectors. After reading the first sector
from the disk and doing the ECC calculation, the data must be transferred to main
memory. While this transfer is taking place, the next sector will fly by the head.
When the copy to memory is complete, the controller will have to wait almost an
entire rotation time for the second sector to come around again.
This problem can be eliminated by numbering the sectors in an interleaved
fashion when formatting the disk. In Fig. 5-21(a), we see the usual numbering 
pattern (ignoring cylinder skew here). In Fig. 5-21(b), we see single interleaving,
which gives the controller some breathing space between consecutive sectors in
order to copy the buffer to main memory.

Figure 5-21. (a) No interleaving. (b) Single interleaving. (c) Double interleaving.
If the copying process is very slow, the double interleaving of Fig. 5-22(c)
may be needed. If the controller has a buffer of only one sector, it does not matter
whether the copying from the buffer to main memory is done by the controller, the
main CPU, or even a DMA chip; it still takes some time. To avoid the need for
