MASS STORAGE: DISK AND SSD

things have changed. First, the disk capacity of the old floppy disk was 360 KB, or
about one third of the capacity needed to store the PDF of just this chapter. In 
contrast, the IronWolf packs as much as 18 TBâ€”an increase of give or take 8 orders of
magnitude. The authors solemnly promise never to make the chapter that big. The
transfer rate also went up from around 23 KB/sec to 250 MB/sec, a jump of 4
orders of magnitude. The latency, howev er, improved more marginally, from
around 100 msec to 4 msec. Better, but you may find it a bit underwhelming.
One thing to be aware of in looking at the specifications of modern hard disks
is that the geometry specified, and used by the driver software, is almost always
different from the physical format. On old disks, the number of sectors per track
was the same for all cylinders. For instance, the IBM PC floppy disk had 9 sectors
of 512 bytes on every track. Modern disks, on the other hand, are divided into
zones with more sectors on the outer zones than the inner ones. Figure 5-18(a) 
illustrates a tiny disk with two zones. The outer zone has 32 sectors per track; the
inner one has 16 sectors per track. A real disk easily has tens of zones, with the
number of sectors increasing per zone as one goes out from the innermost to the
outermost zone.

Figure 5-18. (a) Physical geometry of a disk with two zones. (b) A possible 
virtual geometry for this disk.
To hide the details of how many sectors each track has, most modern disks
have a virtual geometry that is presented to the operating system. The software is
instructed to act as though there are x cylinders, y heads, and z sectors per track.
The controller then remaps a request for (x, y, z) onto the real cylinder, head, and
sector. A possible virtual geometry for the physical disk of Fig. 5-18(a) is shown
in Fig. 5-18(b). In both cases, the disk has 192 sectors, only the published 
arrangement is different than the real one. Simplifying the addressing even more, modern
