22. A computer whose processes have 1024 pages in their address spaces keeps its page
tables in memory. The overhead required for reading a word from the page table is 5
nsec. To reduce this overhead, the computer has a TLB, which holds 32 (virtual page,
physical page frame) pairs, and can do a lookup in 1 nsec. What hit rate is needed to
reduce the mean overhead to 2 nsec?
23. How can the associative memory device needed for a TLB be implemented in 
hardware, and what are the implications of such a design for expandability?
24. A machine has 48-bit virtual addresses and 32-bit physical addresses. Pages are 8 KB.
How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table?
25. A computer with an 8-KB page, a 256-KB main memory, and a 64-GB virtual address
space uses an inverted page table to implement its virtual memory. How big should the
hash table be to ensure a mean hash chain length of less than 1? Assume that the 
hashtable size is a power of two.
26. A student in a compiler design course proposes to the professor a project of writing a
compiler that will produce a list of page references that can be used to implement the
optimal page replacement algorithm. Is this possible? Why or why not? Is there 
anything that could be done to improve paging efficiency at run time?
27. Suppose that the virtual page reference stream contains repetitions of long sequences
of page references followed occasionally by a random page reference. For example, the
sequence: 0, 1, ... , 511, 431, 0, 1, ... , 511, 332, 0, 1, ... consists of repetitions of the
sequence 0, 1, ... , 511 followed by a random reference to pages 431 and 332.
(a) Why will the standard replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, clock) not be effective
in handling this workload for a page allocation that is less than the sequence
length?
(b) If this program were allocated 500 page frames, describe a page replacement
approach that would perform much better than the LRU, FIFO, or clock algorithms.
28. If FIFO page replacement is used with four page frames and eight pages, how many
page faults will occur with the reference string 0172327103 if the four frames are 
initially empty? Now repeat this problem for LRU.
29. Consider the page sequence of Fig. 3-15(b). Suppose that the R bits for the pages B
through A are 11011011, respectively. Which page will second chance remove?
30. A small computer on a smart card has four page frames. At the first clock tick, the R
bits are 0111 (page 0 is 0, the rest are 1). At subsequent clock ticks, the values are
1011, 1010, 1101, 0010, 1010, 1100, and 0001. If the aging algorithm is used with an
8-bit counter, giv e the values of the four counters after the last tick.
31. Give a simple example of a page reference sequence where the first page selected for
replacement will be different for the clock and LRU page replacement algorithms.
Assume that a process is allocated 3=three frames, and the reference string contains
page numbers from the set 0, 1, 2, 3.
32. In the WSClock algorithm of Fig. 3-20(c), the hand points to a page with R = 0. If
