tapes, replaced the input tape with the next batch, and brought the output tape to a
1401 for printing off line (i.e., not connected to the main computer).
The structure of a typical input job is shown in Fig. 1-4. It started out with a
$JOB card, specifying the maximum run time in minutes, the account number to be
charged, and the programmer’s name. Then came a $FORTRAN card, telling the
operating system to load the FORTRAN compiler from the system tape. It was
directly followed by the program to be compiled, and then a $LOAD card, 
directing the operating system to load the object program just compiled. (Compiled 
programs were often written on scratch tapes and had to be loaded explicitly.) Next
came the $RUN card, telling the operating system to run the program with the data
following it. Finally, the $END card marked the end of the job. These control
cards were the forerunners of modern shells and command-line interpreters.

Large, second-generation computers were used mostly for scientific and 
engineering calculations, such as solving the partial differential equations that often
occur in physics and engineering. They were largely programmed in FORTRAN
and assembly language. Typical operating systems were FMS (the Fortran 
Monitor System) and IBSYS, IBM’s operating system for the 7094.
1.2.3 The Third Generation (1965–1980): ICs and Multiprogramming
By the early 1960s, most computer manufacturers had two distinct and 
incompatible, product lines. On the one hand, there were the word-oriented, large-scale
scientific computers, such as the 7094, which were used for industrial-strength
