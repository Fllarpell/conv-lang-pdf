Figure 12-9. Part of the i-node cache for Fig. 4-36.
/usr/ast/grants/erc is presented, the cache returns the fact that /usr/ast is i-node 26,
so the search can start there, eliminating four disk accesses.
A problem with caching paths is that the mapping between file name and 
inode number is not fixed for all time. Suppose that the file /usr/ast/mbox is
removed from the system and its i-node reused for a different file owned by a 
different user. Later, the file /usr/ast/mbox is created again, and this time it gets i-node
106. If nothing is done to prevent it, the cache entry will now be wrong and 
subsequent lookups will return the wrong i-node number. For this reason, when a file or
directory is deleted, its cache entry and (if it is a directory) all the entries below it
must be purged from the cache.
Disk blocks and path names are not the only items that are cacheable. I-nodes
can be cached, too. If pop-up threads are used to handle interrupts, each one of
them requires a stack and some additional machinery. These previously used
threads can also be cached, since refurbishing a used one is easier than creating a
new one from scratch (to avoid having to allocate memory). Just about anything
that is hard to produce can be cached.
12.4.5 Hints
Cache entries are always correct. A cache search may fail, but if it finds an
entry, that entry is guaranteed to be correct and can be used without further ado. In
some systems, it is convenient to have a table of hints. These are suggestions
about the solution, but they are not guaranteed to be correct. The called must verify
the result itself.
A well-known example of hints are the URLs embedded on Web pages. 
Clicking on a link does not guarantee that the Web page pointed to is there. In fact, the
page pointed to may have been removed 10 years ago. Thus the information on the
pointing page is really only a hint.
Hints are also used in connection with remote files. The information in the hint
tells something about the remote file, such as where it is located. However, the file
may have moved or been deleted since the hint was recorded, so a check is always
needed to see if it is correct.
