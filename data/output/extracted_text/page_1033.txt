Figure 11-50. Hyper-V virtualization components in the root and child partitions.
Hypervisor
The hypervisor is a thin layer of software that runs between the hardware and
the operating systems it is hosting. It is the most privileged software on the system
and therefore needs to have a minimal attack surface. For this reason, it delegates
as much functionality as possible to the virtualization stack running in the root 
partition.
The hypervisorâ€™s most important job is to virtualize hardware resources for its
partitions: processors, memory, and devices. Each partition is assigned a set of 
virtual processors (VPs) and guest physical memory. The hypervisor manages these
resources very similar to processes and threads in the operating system. The 
hypervisor internally represents each partition with a process data structure and each VP
with a thread. From this perspective, each partition is an address space and each
VP is a schedulable entity. As such, the hypervisor also includes a scheduler to
schedule VPs on physical processors.
In order to virtualize processors and memory, the hypervisor relies on 
virtualization extensions provided by the underlying hardware. Intel, AMD, and ARM
have slight variations in what they offer, but they are all conceptually similar. In a
nutshell, the hardware defines a higher privilege level for the hypervisor and allows
it to intercept various operations that occur while a processor is executing in guest
mode. For example, when a clock interrupt occurs, the hypervisor gets control and
can decide to switch out the currently running VP and pick another one, potentially
