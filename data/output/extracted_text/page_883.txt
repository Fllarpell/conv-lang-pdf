access as shown in Fig. 10-81. Note that these are essentially the same types of
location access applications and the user could differentiate between back at the
start in Android 1.0! They were hidden from the user, but were still options for the
app, in Android 5.0. Android 12 again shows them explicitly to the user while also
allowing them to override the app’s preference (if it is requesting fine access).
Android 12 also introduced a new ‘‘privacy dashboard,’’ allowing users to see
when apps are accessing their location and other personal data after they hav e
granted that access. Fig. 10-82 shows an example of what a user may see about
location access across their device. This provides a rich tool for users to monitor
what their apps are doing, to reassure themselves they are comfortable with it and
potentially change their decision about an app’s access based on what they see.
The changes we have discussed (from the transition to runtime permissions,
through evolution of location access, to privacy dashboard) all serve to illustrate
how privacy has become a unique aspect of operating system design. Most 
operating system features are better the less the user is aware of them. This is true not
only for security, as we previously described, but generally the better solution for a
problem is one where the operating system can do something so that the user does
not need to think about it. We saw another example of this earlier, with Android 
removing the need for users to think about explicitly starting and stopping their apps.
