character). Thus prog.c is typically a C program, prog.py is typically a Python 
program, and prog.o is usually an object file (compiler output). These conventions are
not enforced by the operating system but some compilers and other programs
expect them. Extensions may be of any length, and files may have multiple 
extensions, as in prog.java.gz, which is probably a gzip compressed Java program.
Files can be grouped together in directories for convenience. Directories are
stored as files and to a large extent can be treated like files. Directories can contain
subdirectories, leading to a hierarchical file system. The root directory is called /
and always contains several subdirectories. The / character is also used to separate
directory names, so that the name /usr/ast/x denotes the file x located in the 
directory ast, which itself is in the /usr directory. Some of the major directories near the
top of the tree are shown in Fig. 10-23.

Figure 10-23. Some important directories found in most Linux systems.
There are two ways to specify file names in Linux, both to the shell and when
opening a file from inside a program. The first way is by means of an absolute
path, which means telling how to get to the file starting at the root directory. An
example of an absolute path is /usr/ast/books/mos5/chap-10. This tells the system
to look in the root directory for a directory called usr, then look there for another
directory, ast. In turn, this directory contains a directory books, which contains the
directory mos5, which contains the file chap-10.
Absolute path names are often long and inconvenient. For this reason, Linux
allows users and processes to designate the directory in which they are currently
working as the working directory. Path names can also be specified relative to
the working directory. A path name specified relative to the working directory is a
relative path. For example, if /usr/ast/books/mos5 is the working directory, then
the shell command
cp chap-10 backup-10
has exactly the same effect as the longer command
cp /usr/ast/books/mos5/chap-10 /usr/ast/books/mos5/backup-10
It frequently occurs that a user needs to refer to a file that belongs to another
user, or at least is located elsewhere in the file tree. For example, if two users are
sharing a file, it will be located in a directory belonging to one of them, so the
