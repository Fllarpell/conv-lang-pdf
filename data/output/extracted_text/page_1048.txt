Figure 11-54. Virtual Secure Mode architecture with NT kernel in VTL0 and 
Secure Kernel in VTL1. VTLs share memory, CPUs, and devices, but each VTL has
its own access protections for these resources, controlled by higher VTLs.
Let us review these items briefly. Secure login means that the system 
administrator can require all users to have a password in order to log in. Spoofing is when
a malicious user writes a program that displays the login prompt or screen and then
walks away from the computer in the hope that an innocent user will sit down and
enter a name and password. The name and password are then written to disk and
the user is told that login has failed. Windows prevents this attack by instructing
users to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL to log in. This key sequence is always captured by
the keyboard driver, which then invokes a system program that puts up the genuine
login screen. This procedure works because there is no way for user processes to
disable CTRL-ALT-DEL processing in the keyboard driver. But NT can and does
disable use of the CTRL-ALT-DEL secure attention sequence in some cases, 
particularly for consumers and in systems that have accessibility for the disabled
enabled, on phones, tablets, and the Xbox, where there is almost never a physical
keyboard with a user entering commands.
