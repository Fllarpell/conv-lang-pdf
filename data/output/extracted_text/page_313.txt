the table will take up 3 GB or 2.4 GB of main memory all the time, depending on
whether the system is optimized for space or time. Not wildly practical. Clearly the
FAT idea does not scale well to large disks. Nevertheless, it was the original 
MSDOS file system and is still fully supported by all versions of Windows though
(and UEFI). Versions of the FAT file system are still commonly used on the SD
cards used in digital cameras, electronic picture frames, music players, and other
portable electronic devices, as well as in other embedded applications.
I-nodes
Our last method for keeping track of which blocks belong to which file is to
associate with each file a data structure called an i-node (index-node), which lists
the attributes and disk addresses of the fileâ€™s blocks. A simple example is depicted
in Fig. 4-15. Given the i-node, it is then possible to find all the blocks of the file.
The big advantage of this scheme over linked files using an in-memory table is that
the i-node needs to be in memory only when the corresponding file is open. If each
i-node occupies n bytes and a maximum of k files may be open at once, the total
memory occupied by the array holding the i-nodes for the open files is only kn
bytes. Only this much space need be reserved in advance.

This array is usually far smaller than the space occupied by the file table
described in the previous section. The reason is simple. The table for holding the
