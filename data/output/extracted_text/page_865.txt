These two examples give a final illustration of the importance of cached 
processes. If the email application again needs to use the camera provider, the 
provider’s process will typically already be left as a cached process. Using it again is
then just a matter of setting the process back to the foreground and reconnecting
with the content provider that is already sitting there with its database initialized.
10.8.11 Security and Privacy
When Android was being designed, the security protections users have from
their applications was an area of rapidly evolving expectations that needed to be
addressed. Since then, privacy has become an increasingly important area driving
significant evolution to how Android manages applications. We will now look at
these two topics, focusing first on the various aspects of security before looking at
the newer world of privacy.
