Problem 3 solution: 
A small mass slides down with zero initial velocity from the top of a smooth 
hill of height H. The foot of the hill has a portion of horizontal surface before the 
vertical cliff of height h as shown on Figure.   
1. 
What must be the height of the horizontal portion (h/H = ?) to 
ensure the maximum distance s covered by the flying mass?   
2. 
What the maximum distance s measured in H equals to?  
Given: 
Initial velocity 𝑉0= 0 
Height of incline 𝐻 
Height of cliff ℎ  
 
Find:  
1. The ratio 
ℎ
𝐻 that maximizes 
the horizontal distance 𝑠. 
2. The maximum horizontal 
distance 𝑠 in terms of 𝐻. 
 
Solution: 
Calculate the horizontal velocity 𝑉: 
𝑉= √2𝑔(𝐻−ℎ) 
Calculate the time 𝑡 of free fall from height ℎ: 
𝑡= √2ℎ
𝑔 
Calculate the horizontal distance 𝑠: 
 
𝑠= 𝑉⋅𝑡= √2𝑔(𝐻−ℎ) ⋅√2ℎ
𝑔= √4(𝐻−ℎ)ℎ 
(1) 
Maximize 𝑠 by finding the optimal 
ℎ
𝐻: we find the derivative of s with 
respect to ℎ and set it to zero: 
ⅆ
ⅆℎ√4(𝐻−ℎ)ℎ= 0 
 
ℎ
𝐻= 1
2 => ℎ= 𝐻
2 
(2) 
Substituting [Eq. 2] to [Eq.1]: 
𝑠= 𝐻 
 
Answer: 
1. ℎ
𝐻= 1
2  
2. 𝑠= 𝐻
