INPUT/OUTPUT
In addition to providing abstractions such as processes, address spaces, and
files, an operating system also controls all the computerâ€™s I/O (Input/Output) 
devices. It must issue commands to the devices, catch interrupts, and handle errors.
It should also provide an interface between the devices and the rest of the system
that is simple and easy to use. To the extent possible, the interface should be the
same for all devices (device independence). The I/O code represents a significant
fraction of the total operating system. How the operating system manages I/O is
the subject of this chapter.
This chapter is organized as follows. We will look first at some of the 
principles of I/O hardware and then at I/O software in general. I/O software can be
structured in layers, with each having a well-defined task. We will look at these
layers to see what they do and how they fit together.
Next, we will look at several I/O devices in detail: disks, clocks, keyboards,
and displays. For each device, we will look at its hardware and software. Finally,
we will consider power management.
5.1 PRINCIPLES OF I/O HARDWARE
Different people look at I/O hardware in different ways. Electrical engineers
look at it in terms of chips, wires, power supplies, motors, and all the other 
physical components that comprise the hardware. Programmers look at the interface
