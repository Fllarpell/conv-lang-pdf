DEADLOCKS 
CHAP. 6
47. Write a program that detects if there is a deadlock in the system by using a resource
allocation graph. Your program should read from a file the following inputs: the 
number of processes and the number of resources. For each process it should read four
numbers: the number of resources it is currently holding, the IDs of resources it is
holding, the number of resources it is currently requesting, and the IDs of resources it
is requesting. The output of program should indicate if there is a deadlock in the 
system. In case there is, the program should print out the identities of all processes that are
deadlocked.
48. In certain countries, when two people meet they bow to each other. The protocol is that
one of them bows first and stays down until the other one bows. If they bow at the
same time, they will not know who should stand up straight first, thus creating a 
deadlock. Write a program that does not deadlock.
49. In Chap. 2, we have studied monitors. Solve the dining philosophers problem using
monitors instead of semaphores.
