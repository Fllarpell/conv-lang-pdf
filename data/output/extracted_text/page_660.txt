Figure 9-11. The Bell-LaPadula multilevel security model.
The simple security property says that all solid (read) arrows go sideways or
upward. The * property says that all dashed (write) arrows also go sideways or
upward. Since information flows only horizontally or upward, any information that
starts out at level k can never appear at a lower level. In other words, there is never
a path that moves information downward, thus guaranteeing the security of the
model.
The Bell-LaPadula model refers to organizational structure, but ultimately has
to be enforced by the operating system. One way this could be done is by 
assigning each user a security level, to be stored along with other user-specific data such
as the UID and GID. Upon login, the user’s shell would acquire the user’s security
level and this would be inherited by all its children. If a process running at security
level k attempted to open a file or other object whose security level is greater than
k, the operating system should reject the open attempt. Similarly attempts to open
any object of security level less than k for writing must fail. This is extremely 
simple and easy to enforce. Just add two if statements to the code and, bingo, a secure
system—at least for the military.
The Biba Model
To summarize the Bell-LaPadula model in military terms, a lieutenant can ask
a private to reveal all he knows and then copy this information into a general’s file
without violating security. Now let us put the same model in civilian terms. 
Imagine a company in which janitors have security level 1, computer programmers have
security level 3, and the president of the company has security level 5. Using
