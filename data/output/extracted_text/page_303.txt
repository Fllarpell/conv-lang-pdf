What is needed is a hierarchy (i.e., a tree of directories). With this approach,
there can be as many directories as are needed to group the files in natural ways.
Furthermore, if multiple users share a common file server, as is the case on many
company networks, each user can have a private root directory for his or her own
hierarchy. This approach is shown in Fig. 4-8. Here, the directories A, B, and C
contained in the root directory each belong to a different user, two of whom have
created subdirectories for projects they are working on.

The ability for users to create an arbitrary number of subdirectories provides a
powerful structuring tool for users to organize their work. For this reason, all 
modern file systems are organized in this manner. It is worth noting that an hierarchical
file system is one of many things that was pioneered by Multics in the 1960s.
4.2.3 Path Names
When the file system is organized as a directory tree, some way is needed for
specifying file names. Two different methods are commonly used. In the first
method, each file is given an absolute path name consisting of the path from the
root directory to the file. As an example, the path /usr/ast/mailbox means that the
root directory contains a subdirectory usr, which in turn contains a subdirectory
ast, which contains the file mailbox. Absolute path names always start at the root
directory and are unique. In UNIX the components of the path are separated by /.
In Windows the separator is \ . In MULTICS it was >. Thus, the same path name
would be written as follows in these three systems:
Windows 
\usr\ast\mailbox
UNIX 
/usr/ast/mailbox
MULTICS 
>usr>ast>mailbox
