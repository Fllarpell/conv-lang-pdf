3. Hardware-accelerated devices: While paravirtualized I/O is much
more efficient than device emulation, it still has too much root CPU
overhead especially when it comes to todayâ€™s high-end networking
devices used in data centers or NVMe disks. Such devices support
SR-IOV (Single-Root I/O Virtualization) or DDA (Discrete Device
Assignment). Either way, the virtual PCI VDEV, working with the
vPCI VSP/VSC, exposes the device to the guest on the virtual PCI
bus. This is either a virtual function (VF) for SR-IOV devices or a
physical function (PF) for DDA. The guest loads the corresponding
device driver and is able to communicate directly with the device
because its MMIO space is mapped into guest memory via the
IOMMU. The IOMMU is also configured by the hypervisor to ensure
that the device can only perform I/O to pages exposed to the guest.

VA-backed VMs
Typically, the VID driver allocates dedicated physical memory for each virtual
machine and maps it into the GPA space through the SLAT. This memory belongs
to the VM whether it is using it or not. Hyper-V also supports a different model for
managing VM memory, called VA-backed VMs, which provides more flexibility.
