Figure 8-29 shows a portion of the Internet. At the top we have one of the
backbones, normally operated by a backbone operator. It consists of a number of
routers connected by high-bandwidth fiber optics, with connections to backbones
operated by other (competing) telephone companies. Usually, no hosts connect
directly to the backbone, other than maintenance and test machines run by the 
telephone company.

Figure 8-29. A portion of the Internet.
Attached to the backbone routers by medium-speed fiber optic connections are
regional networks and routers at ISPs. In turn, corporate Ethernets each have a
router on them and these are connected to regional network routers. Routers at
ISPs are connected to modem banks used by the ISPâ€™s customers. In this way,
ev ery host on the Internet has at least one path, and often many paths, to every
other host.
All traffic on the Internet is sent in the form of packets. Each packet carries its
destination address inside it, and this address is used for routing. When a packet
comes into a router, the router extracts the destination address and looks (part of) it
up in a table to find which outgoing line to send the packet on and thus to which
router. This procedure is repeated until the packet reaches the destination host.
The routing tables are highly dynamic and are updated continuously as routers and
links go down and come back up and as traffic conditions change. The routing
algorithms have been intensively studied and modified over the years. No doubt
they will continue to be studied and modified in the years ahead as well.
