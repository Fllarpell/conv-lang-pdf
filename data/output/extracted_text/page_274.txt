segment descriptor. The address of the segment in secondary memory was not in the
segment descriptor but in another table used by the segment fault handler.

Figure 3-34. The MULTICS virtual memory. (a) The descriptor segment 
pointed to the page tables. (b) A segment descriptor. The numbers are the field
lengths.
Each segment was an ordinary virtual address space and was paged in the same
way as the nonsegmented paged memory described earlier in this chapter. The 
normal page size was 1024 words (although a few small segments used by MULTICS
itself were not paged or were paged in units of 64 words to save physical memory).
