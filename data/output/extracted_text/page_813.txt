Figure 10-35. Examples of remote mounted file systems. Directories are shown
as squares and files as circles.
1. Diskless workstations often have only a skeleton file system (in RAM) and get
all their files from remote servers like this. Similarly, client 1 has mounted server
2â€™s directory /projects on its directory /usr/ast/work so it can now access file a as
/usr/ast/work/proj1/a. Finally, client 2 has also mounted the projects directory and
can also access file a, only as /mnt/proj1/a. As seen here, the same file can have
different names on different clients due to its being mounted in a different place in
the respective trees. The mount point is entirely local to the clients; the server does
not know where it is mounted on any of its clients.
NFS Protocols
Since one of the goals of NFS is to support a heterogeneous system, with 
clients and servers possibly running different operating systems on different 
hardware, it is essential that the interface between the clients and servers be well
defined. Only then is anyone able to write a new client implementation and expect
it to work correctly with existing servers, and vice versa.
NFS accomplishes this goal by defining two client-server protocols. A 
protocol is a set of requests sent by clients to servers, along with the corresponding
replies sent by the servers back to the clients.
