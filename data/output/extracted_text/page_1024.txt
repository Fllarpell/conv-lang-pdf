hard to place the second logical block in block 21, the third logical block in 22,
and so on. One way to achieve these runs is to allocate disk storage several blocks
at a time, when possible.
The blocks in a stream are described by a sequence of records, each one
describing a sequence of logically contiguous blocks. For a stream with no holes
in it, there will be only one such record. Streams that are written in order from
beginning to end all belong in this category. For a stream with one hole in it (e.g.,
only blocks 0–49 and blocks 60–79 are defined), there will be two records. Such a
stream could be produced by writing the first 50 blocks, then seeking forward to
logical block 60 and writing another 20 blocks. When a hole is read back, all the
missing bytes are zeros. Files with holes are called sparse files.
Each record begins with a header giving the offset of the first block within the
stream. Next comes the offset of the first block not covered by the record. In the
example above, the first record would have a header of (0, 50) and would provide
the disk addresses for these 50 blocks. The second one would have a header of
(60, 80) and would provide the disk addresses for these 20 blocks.
Each record header is followed by one or more pairs, each giving a disk
address and run length. The disk address is the offset of the disk block from the
start of its partition; the run length is the number of blocks in the run. As many
pairs as needed can be in the run record. Use of this scheme for a three-run, 
nineblock stream is illustrated in Fig. 11-46.

Figure 11-46. An MFT record for a three-run, nine-block stream.
In this figure, we have an MFT record for a short stream of nine blocks (header
0–8). It consists of the three runs of consecutive blocks on the disk. The first run is
blocks 20–23, the second is blocks 64–65, and the third is blocks 80–82. Each of
these runs is recorded in the MFT record as a (disk address, block count) pair. How
many runs there are depends on how well the disk block allocator did in finding
runs of consecutive blocks when the stream was created. For an n-block stream, the
number of runs can be anything from 1 through n.
