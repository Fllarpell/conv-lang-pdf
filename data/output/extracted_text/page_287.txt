will be one of the other pages with equal probability.
(a) Demonstrate that the page reference string-generation routine behaves properly for
some small N.
(b) Compute the page fault rate for a small example in which there is one process and a
fixed number of page frames. Explain why the behavior is correct.
(c) Repeat part (b) with two processes with independent page reference sequences and
twice as many page frames as in part (b).
(d) Repeat part (c) but using a global policy instead of a local one. Also, contrast the
per-process page fault rate with that of the local policy approach.
55. Write a program that can be used to compare the effectiveness of adding a tag field to
TLB entries when control is toggled between two programs. The tag field is used to
effectively label each entry with the process id. Note that a nontagged TLB can be 
simulated by requiring that all TLB entries have the same tag at any one time. The inputs
will be:
• The number of TLB entries available
• The clock interrupt interval expressed as number of memory references
• A file containing a sequence of (process, page references) entries
• The cost to update one TLB entry
(a) Describe the basic data structures and algorithms in your implementation.
b) Show that your simulation behaves as expected for a simple (but nontrivial) input
example.
(c) Plot the number of TLB updates per 1000 references.
