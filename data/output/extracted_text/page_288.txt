All computer applications need to store and retrieve information. While a 
process is running, it can store a limited amount of information in physical RAM. For
many applications, the amount of memory is far too small and some even need
many terabytes of storage.
A second problem with keeping information in RAM is that when the process
terminates, the information is lost. For many applications (e.g., for databases), the
information must be retained for weeks, months, or even forever. Having it vanish
when the process using it terminates is unacceptable. Furthermore, it must not go
aw ay when a computer crash kills the process or power goes off during an 
electrical storm.
A third problem is that it is frequently necessary for multiple processes to
access (parts of) the information at the same time. If we have an online telephone
directory stored inside the address space of a single process, only that process can
access it, unless it is shared explicitly. The way to solve this problem is to make the
information itself independent of any one process.
Thus, we have three essential requirements for long-term information storage:
1. It must be possible to store a very large amount of information.
2. The information must survive the termination of the process using it.
3. Multiple processes must be able to access the information at once.
Magnetic disks have been used for years for this long-term storage. While such
disks are still used extensively, solid-state drives (SSDs) have also become hugely
