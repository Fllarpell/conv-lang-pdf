PREFACE
We were also fortunate to have sev eral reviewers who read the manuscript and
also suggested new end-of-chapter problems. They were Jeremiah Blanchard
(University of Florida), Kate Holdener (St. Louis University), Liting Hu (Virginia
Tech), Jiang-Bo Liu (Bradley University), and Mai Zheng (Iowa State University).
We remain responsible for any remaining errors, of course.
Several people at the VUSec group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam also
played an important role in this edition. We are grateful to Cristiano Giuffrida for
his many excellent suggestions of things to add to or remove from the previous
text. Meanwhile, Erik van der Kouwe, Sebastian Osterlund, Johannes Blaser were
amazing in how fast they provided fantastic feedback on all the new bits in the
security chapter.
We would also like to thank our editor, Tracy Johnson, for keeping the project
on track and herding all the cats, albeit virtually this time. Erin Sullivan managed
the review process and Carole Snyder handled production.
Finally, last but not least, Barbara, Marvin, and Matilde are still wonderful, as
usual, each in a unique and special way. Aron and Nathan are great kids and
Olivia and Mirte are treasures. And of course, I would like to thank Suzanne for
her love and patience, not to mention all the druiven, kersen, and sinaasappelsap,
as well as other agricultural products. (AST)
As always, I owe a massive thank you to Marieke, Duko, and Jip. Marieke for
just being there and for bearing with me in the countless hours that I was working
on this book, and Duko and Jip for tearing me away from it to play hoops, day and
night! I am also grateful to the neighbors for putting up with our midnight 
basketball games. (HB)
