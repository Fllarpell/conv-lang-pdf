7. New process loads the code for the application being run.
8. Activity manager sends to the new process any pending operations, in
this case ‘‘start activity X.’’
9. New process receives the command to start an activity, instantiates the
appropriate Java class, and executes it.

Figure 10-62. Steps in launching a new application process.
Note that when we started this activity, the application’s process may already
have been running. In that case, the activity manager will simply skip to the end,
sending a new command to the process telling it to instantiate and run the 
appropriate component. This can result in an additional activity instance running in the
application, if appropriate, as we saw previously in Fig. 10-56.
Process Lifecycle
The activity manager is also responsible for determining when processes are
no longer needed. It keeps track of all activities, receivers, services, and content
providers running in a process; from this it can determine how important (or not)
the process is.
Recall that Android’s out-of-memory killer in the kernel uses a process’s
importance as given to lmkd as a strict ordering to determine which processes it
