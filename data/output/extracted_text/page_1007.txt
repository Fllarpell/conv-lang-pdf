blocks, that is, regions of files. This approach fits well with the structure of the
native NT File System (NTFS), as we will see in Sec. 11.8. NTFS stores all of its
data as files, including the file-system metadata.
The cached regions of files are called views because they represent regions of
kernel virtual addresses that are mapped onto file-system files. Thus, the actual
management of the physical memory in the cache is provided by the memory 
manager. The role of the cache manager is to manage the use of kernel virtual 
addresses for views, arrange with the memory manager to pin pages in physical memory,
and provide interfaces for the file systems.
The Windows cache-manager facilities are shared among all the file systems.
Because the cache is virtually addressed according to individual files, the cache
manager is easily able to perform read-ahead on a per-file basis. Requests to access
cached data come from each file system. Virtual caching is convenient because the
file systems do not have to first translate file offsets into physical block numbers
before requesting a cached file page. Instead, the translation happens later when
the memory manager calls the file system to access the page on disk.
Besides management of the kernel virtual address and physical memory
resources used for caching, the cache manager also has to coordinate with file 
systems regarding issues like coherency of views, flushing to disk, and correct 
maintenance of the end-of-file marksâ€”particularly as files expand. One of the most 
difficult aspects of a file to manage between the file system, the cache manager, and
the memory manager is the offset of the last byte in the file, called the 
ValidDataLength. If a program writes past the end of the file, the blocks that were
