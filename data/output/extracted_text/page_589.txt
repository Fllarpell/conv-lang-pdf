1024 nodes but a diameter of only 10, giving excellent delay properties. Note that
in contrast, 1024 nodes arranged as a 32 × 32 grid have a diameter of 62, more
than six times worse than the hypercube. The price paid for the smaller diameter is
that the fanout, and thus the number of links (and the cost), is much larger for the
hypercube.
Tw o kinds of switching schemes are used in multicomputers. In the first one,
each message is first broken up (either by the user software or the network 
interface) into a chunk of some maximum length called a packet. The switching
scheme, called store-and-forward packet switching, consists of the packet being
injected into the first switch by the source node’s network interface board, as
shown in Fig. 8-17(a). The bits come in one at a time, and when the whole packet
has arrived at an input buffer, it is copied to the line leading to the next switch
along the path, as shown in Fig. 8-17(b). When the packet arrives at the switch
attached to the destination node, as shown in Fig. 8-17(c), the packet is copied to
that node’s network interface board and eventually to its RAM.

Figure 8-17. Store-and-forward packet switching.
While store-and-forward packet switching is flexible and efficient, it does have
the problem of increasing latency (delay) through the interconnection network.
Suppose that the time to move a packet one hop in Fig. 8-17 is T nsec. Since the
packet must be copied four times to get it from CPU 1 to CPU 2 (to A, to C, to D,
and to the destination CPU), and no copy can begin until the previous one is 
finished, the latency through the interconnection network is 4T. One way out is to
design a network in which a packet can be logically divided into smaller units. As
soon as the first unit arrives at a switch, it can be forwarded, even before the tail
has arrived. Conceivably, the unit could be as small as 1 bit.
The other switching regime, circuit switching, consists of the first switch first
establishing a path through all the switches to the destination switch. Once that
