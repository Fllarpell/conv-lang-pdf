11.1.1 1980s: MS-DOS
In the early 1980s IBM, at the time the biggest and most powerful computer
company in the world, was developing a personal computer based the Intel 8088
microprocessor. Since the mid-1970s, Microsoft had become the leading provider
of the BASIC programming language for 8-bit microcomputers based on the 8080
and Z-80. When IBM approached Microsoft about licensing BASIC for the new
IBM PC, Microsoft readily agreed to the deal and suggested that IBM contact 
Digital Research to license its CP/M operating system since Microsoft was not then in
the operating system business. IBM did that, but the president of Digital Research,
Gary Kildall, was too busy to meet with IBM. This was probably the worst blunder
