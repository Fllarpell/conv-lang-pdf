Multilevel Page Tables
As a first approach, consider the use of a multilevel page table. A simple 
example is shown in Fig. 3-13. In Fig. 3-13(a) we have a 32-bit virtual address that is
partitioned into a 10-bit PT1 field, a 10-bit PT2 field, and a 12-bit Offset field.
Since offsets are 12 bits, pages are 4 KB, and there are a total of 220 of them.

The secret to the multilevel page table method is to avoid keeping all the page
tables in memory all the time. In particular, those that are not needed should not
