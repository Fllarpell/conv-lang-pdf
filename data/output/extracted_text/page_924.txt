for the compiler runtime and low-level libraries, similar to what is in libc in UNIX.
ntdll.dll also contains special code entry points used by the kernel to initialize
threads and dispatch exceptions and user-mode asynchronous procedure calls
(described later). Because the system library is so integral to the operation of the
kernel, every user-mode process created by NTOS has ntdll mapped at the same
address (the particular address is randomized in every boot session as a security
measure). When NTOS is initializing the system, it creates a section object to use
when mapping ntdll, and it also records addresses of the ntdll entry points used by
the kernel.
Below the NTOS kernel and executive layers is a layer of software called the
HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) which abstracts low-level hardware details
like access to device registers and DMA operations, and the way the motherboard
firmware represents configuration information and deals with differences in the
CPU support chips, such as various interrupt controllers.
The lowest software layer is the hypervisor which is the core of Windowsâ€™ 
virtualization stack, called Hyper-V. It is a Type-1 (bare metal) hypervisor that runs
on top of the hardware and supports concurrently running multiple operating 
systems. The hypervisor relies on the virtualization stack components running in the
root operating system to virtualize guest operating systems. The hypervisor was an
optional feature in earlier versions of Windows, but Windows 11 enables 
virtualization by default in order to provide critical security features which we will
describe in subsequent sections. Hyper-V requires a 64-bit processor with 
hardware virtualization support and this is reflected in the minimum hardware 
requirements of the OS. Consequently, older computers cannot run Windows 11.
