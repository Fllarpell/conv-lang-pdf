that word 0 is part of a hole and that the highest word in memory contains valid data.
4. Consider a swapping system in which memory consists of the following hole sizes in
memory order: 10 MB, 4 MB, 20 MB, 18 MB, 7 MB, 9 MB, 12 MB, and 15 MB.
Which hole is taken for successive segment requests of
(a) 12 MB
(b) 10 MB
(c) 9 MB
for first fit? Now repeat the question for best fit, worst fit, and next fit.
5. What is the difference between a physical address and a virtual address?
6. For each of the following decimal virtual addresses, compute the virtual page number
and offset for a 4-KB page and for an 8-KB page: 20000, 32768, 60000.
7. Using the page table of Fig. 3-9, give the physical address corresponding to each of the
following virtual addresses:
(a) 20
(b) 4100
(c) 8300
8. The Intel 8086 processor did not have an MMU or support virtual memory. Nev 
ertheless, some companies sold systems that contained an unmodified 8086 CPU and did
paging. Make an educated guess as to how they did it. (Hint: Think about the logical
location of the MMU.)
9. What kind of hardware support is needed for a paged virtual memory to work?
10. Copy on write is an interesting idea used on server systems. Does it make any sense on
a smartphone?
11. Consider the following C program:
int 
X[N];
int step = M;
/* M is some predefined constant */
for (int i = 0; i < N; i += step) X[i] = X[i] + 1;
(a) If this program is run on a machine with a 4-KB page size and 64-entry TLB, what
values of M and N will cause a TLB miss for every execution of the inner loop?
(b) Would your answer in part (a) be different if the loop were repeated many times?
Explain.
12. The amount of disk space that must be available for page storage is related to the 
maximum number of processes, n, the number of bytes in the virtual address space, v, and
the number of bytes of RAM, r. Giv e an expression for the worst-case disk-space
requirements. How realistic is this amount?
13. If an instruction takes 1 nsec and a page fault takes an additional n nsec, give a formula
for the effective instruction time if page faults occur every k instructions.
14. A machine has a 32-bit address space and an 8-KB page. The page table is entirely in
hardware, with one 32-bit word per entry. When a process starts, the page table is 
cop
