READING LIST AND BIBLIOGRAPHY
CHAP. 13
Arpaci-Dusseau and Arpaci-Dusseau, ‘‘Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces’’
This book has a rich section on virtual memory in Chapters 12–23 and
includes a nice overview of page replacement policies.
13.1.4 File Systems
McKusick et al., ‘‘A Fast File System for UNIX’’
The UNIX file system was completely redone for 4.2 BSD. This paper
describes the design of the new file system, with emphasis on its performance.
Silberschatz et al., Operating System Concepts, 10th ed.
Chapters 10–12 are about storage hardware and file systems. They cover file
operations, interfaces, access methods, directories, and implementation, among
other topics.
Stallings, Operating Systems, 9th ed.
Chapter 12 contains a fair amount of material about file systems and little bit
about their security.
Cornwell, ‘‘Anatomy of a Solid-state Drive’’
If you are interested in solid state drives, Michael Cornwell’s introduction is a
good starting point. In particular, the author succinctly describes the way in way
traditional hard drives and SSDs differ.
Timmer, ‘‘Inching Closer to a DNA-Based File System’’
We explained how disks are in the process of being replaced by SSD in many
areas of computing, but flash memory is not the end of history either. Researchers
are looking at storage in other media, such as glass, or even DNA!
Waddington and Harris, ‘‘Software Challenges for the Changing Storage 
Landscape’’
Operating systems are struggling to keep up with new dev elopments in storage.
In this article, Waddington and Harris talk us through some of the software 
challenges for monolithic operating systems.
13.1.5 Input/Output
Geist and Daniel, ‘‘A Continuum of Disk Scheduling Algorithms’’
A generalized disk-arm scheduling algorithm is presented. Extensive 
simulation and experimental results are given.
Scheible, ‘‘A Survey of Storage Options’’
There are many ways to store bits these days: DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, flash
