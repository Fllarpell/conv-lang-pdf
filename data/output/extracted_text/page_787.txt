files. In some cases, device parameters must be set, and this is done using a special
system call. We will study these issues in the following sections.
10.5.1 Fundamental Concepts
Like all computers, those running Linux have I/O devices such as disks, 
printers, and networks connected to them. Some way is needed to allow programs to
access these devices. Although various solutions are possible, the Linux one is to
integrate the devices into the file system as what are called special files. Each I/O
device is assigned a path name, usually in /dev. For example, a disk might be
/dev/hd1, a printer might be /dev/lp, and the network might be /dev/net.
These special files can be accessed the same way as any other files. No special
commands or system calls are needed. The usual open, read, and wr ite system
calls will do just fine. For example, the command
cp file /dev/lp
copies the file to printer, causing it to be printed (assuming that the user has 
permission to access /dev/lp). Programs can open, read, and write special files exactly
the same way as they do regular files. In fact, cp in the above example is not even
aw are that it is printing. In this way, no special mechanism is needed for doing
I/O.
Special files are divided into two categories, block and character. A block 
special file is one consisting of a sequence of numbered blocks. The key property of
the block special file is that each block can be individually addressed and accessed.
In other words, a program can open a block special file and read, say, block 124
without first having to read blocks 0 to 123. Block special files are typically used
for disks (and SSDs, of course).
Character special files are normally used for devices that input or output a
character stream. Keyboards, printers, networks, mice, plotters, and most other I/O
devices that accept or produce data for people use character special files. It is not
possible (or even meaningful) to seek to block 124 on a mouse.
Associated with each special file is a device driver that handles the 
corresponding device. Each driver has what is called a major device number that serves to
identify it. If a driver supports multiple devices, say, two disks of the same type,
each disk has a minor device number that identifies it. Together, the major and
minor device numbers uniquely specify every I/O device. In few cases, a single
driver handles two closely related devices. For example, the driver corresponding
to /dev/tty controls both the keyboard and the screen, often thought of as a single
device, the terminal.
Although most character special files cannot be randomly accessed, they often
need to be controlled in ways that block special files do not. Consider, for example,
input typed on the keyboard and displayed on the screen. When a user makes a
typing error and wants to erase the last character typed, he presses some key. Some
