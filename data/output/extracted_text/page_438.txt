Icons, Menus, and Pointing device, respectively. Windows are rectangular blocks
of screen area used to run programs. Icons are little symbols that can be clicked on
to cause some action to happen. Menus are lists of actions from which one can be
chosen. Finally, a pointing device is a mouse, trackball, or other hardware device
used to move a cursor around the screen to select items.
The GUI software can be implemented in either user-level code, as is done in
UNIX systems, or in the operating system itself, as in the case in Windows.
Input for GUI systems still uses the keyboard and mouse, but output almost
always goes to a special hardware board called a graphics card. A graphics
adapter contains a special memory called video RAM that holds the images that
appear on the screen. Graphics adapters often have a powerful GPU (Graphics
Processing Unit) with 8–16 GB (or more) of their own RAM, separate from the
computer’s main memory.
Each graphics adapter supports some number of screen sizes. Common sizes
(horizontal × vertical in pixels) are 1600 × 1200, 1920 × 1080, 2560 × 1600, and
3840 × 2160. However, there are also displays offering higher resolutions (say,
5120 × 2880 or 6016 × 3384). Higher resolutions are intended to be used on 
widescreen monitors whose 16:9 aspect ratio matches them exactly. At a resolution of
just 1920 × 1080 (the size of full HD videos), a color display with 24 bits/pixel 
requires about 6.2 MB of RAM just to hold the image, so with 8 GB, the graphics
adapter can hold 1380 images at once. If the full screen is refreshed 60 times/sec,
the video RAM must be capable of delivering data continuously at 372 MB/sec.
Of course, 4K video is 3840 × 2160, so it needs four times as much storage and
bandwidth.
Output software for GUIs is a massive topic. Many 1500-page books have
been written about the Windows GUI alone (e.g., Petzold, 2013; Rector and 
Newcomer, 1997; and Simon, 1997). Clearly, in this section, we can only scratch the
surface and present a few of the underlying concepts. To make the discussion 
concrete, we will describe the Win32 API, which is supported by all 32-bit and 64-bit
versions of Windows. The output software for other GUIs is roughly comparable
in a general sense, but the details are very different.
The basic item on the screen is a rectangular area called a window. A 
window’s position and size are uniquely determined by giving the coordinates (in 
pixels) of two diagonally opposite corners. A window may contain a title bar, a menu
bar, a tool bar, a vertical scroll bar, and a horizontal scroll bar. A typical window is
shown in Fig. 5-35. Note that the Windows coordinate system puts the origin in
the upper left-hand corner and has y increase downward, which is different from
the Cartesian coordinates used in mathematics.
When a window is created, the parameters specify whether it can be moved by
the user, resized by the user, or scrolled (by dragging the thumb on the scroll bar)
by the user. The main window produced by most programs can be moved, resized,
and scrolled, which has enormous consequences for the way Windows programs
are written. In particular, programs must be informed about changes to the size of
