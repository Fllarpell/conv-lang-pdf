FILE-SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

The device component that is responsible for handling such wear-leveling is
known as the FTL (Flash Translation Layer). It has many other responsibilities
also and it is sometimes referred to as the drive’s secret sauce. The secret sauce
typically runs on a simple processor with access to fast memory. It is shown on the
left in Fig. 4-20. The data are stored in the flash packages (FPs) on the right. Each
flash package consists of multiple dies and each die in turn contains a number of
so-called planes: collections of flash blocks containing flash pages.

"Secret sauce"
Figure 4-20. Components inside a typical flash SSD.
To access a specific flash page on the SSD, we need to address the 
corresponding die on the appropriate flash package, and on that die the right plane, block and
page—a rather complicated, hierarchical address! Unfortunately, this is not how
file systems work at all. The file system simply requests to read a disk block at a
linear, logical disk address. How does the SSD translate between these logical
addresses and the complex physical addresses on the device? Here is a hint: the
Flash Translation Layer was not given its name for nothing.
Much like the paging mechanism in virtual memory, the FTL uses translation
tables to indicate that logical block 54321 is really at die 0 of flash package 1, in
plane 2 and block 5. Such translation tables are handy also for wear leveling, since
the device is free to move a page to a different block (for instance, because it needs
to be updated), as long as it adjusts the mapping in the translation table.
The FTL also takes care of managing blocks and pages that are no longer
needed. Suppose that after deleting or moving data a few times, a flash block 
contains several invalid flash pages. Since only some of the pages are now valid, the
device can free up space by copying the remaining valid pages to a block which
still has free pages available and then erasing the original block. This is known as
garbage collection. In reality, things are much more complicated. For instance,
when do we do garbage collection? If we do it constantly and as early as possible,
it may interfere with the user’s I/O requests. If we do it too late, we may run out of
free blocks. A reasonable compromise is to do it during idle periods, when the
SSD is not busy otherwise.
