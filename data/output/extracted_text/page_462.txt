18. How much cylinder skew is needed for a 7200-RPM disk with a track-to-track seek
time of 1 msec? The disk has 200 sectors of 512 bytes each on each track.
19. A disk rotates at 7200 RPM. It has 500 sectors of 512 bytes around the outer cylinder.
How long does it take to read a sector?
20. Calculate the maximum data rate in bytes/sec for the disk described in the previous
problem.
21. RAID level 3 is able to correct single-bit errors using only one parity drive. What is the
point of RAID level 2? After all, it also can only correct one error and takes more
drives to do so.
22. A RAID can fail if two or more of its drives crash within a short time interval. Suppose
that the probability of one drive crashing in a given hour is p. What is the probability
of a k-drive RAID failing in a given hour?
23. Compare RAID level 0 through 5 with respect to read performance, write performance,
space overhead, and reliability.
24. How many pebibytes are there in a zebibyte?
25. Why are optical storage devices inherently capable of higher data density than 
magnetic storage devices? Note: This problem requires some knowledge of high-school
physics and how magnetic fields are generated.
26. What are the advantages and disadvantages of optical disks versus magnetic disks?
27. If a disk controller writes the bytes it receives from the disk to memory as fast as it
receives them, with no internal buffering, is interleaving conceivably useful? Discuss.
28. If a disk has double interleaving, does it also need cylinder skew in order to avoid
missing data when making a track-to-track seek? Discuss your answer.
29. Consider a magnetic disk consisting of 16 heads and 400 cylinders. This disk has four
100-cylinder zones with the cylinders in different zones containing 160, 200, 240. and
280 sectors, respectively. Assume that each sector contains 512 bytes, average seek
time between adjacent cylinders is 1 msec, and the disk rotates at 7200 RPM. 
Calculate the (a) disk capacity, (b) optimal track skew, and (c) maximum data transfer rate.
30. A disk manufacturer has two disks that each have 10,000 cylinders. The newer one has
double the linear recording density of the older one. Which disk properties are better
on the newer drive and which are the same? Are any worse on the newer one?
31. Suppose some clever computer science student decides to redesign the MBR and 
partition table of a hard disk to provide more than four partitions. What are some 
consequences of this change?
32. Disk requests come in to the disk driver for cylinders 10, 22, 20, 2, 40, 6, and 38, in
that order. A seek takes 6 msec per cylinder. How much seek time is needed for
(a) First-come, first served.
(b) Closest cylinder next.
(c) Elevator algorithm (initially moving upward).
In all cases, the arm is initially at cylinder 20.
