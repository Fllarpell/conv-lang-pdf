4.4 FILE-SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION
Making the file system work is one thing; making it work efficiently and
robustly in real life is something quite different. In the following sections, we will
look at some of the issues involved in managing disks.
4.4.1 Disk-Space Management
Files are normally stored on disk, so management of disk space is a major 
concern to file-system designers. Two general strategies are possible for storing an n
byte file: n consecutive bytes of disk space are allocated, or the file is split up into
a number of (not necessarily) contiguous blocks†. The same trade-off is present in
memory-management systems between pure segmentation and paging.
As we have seen, storing a file simply as a contiguous sequence of bytes has
†Disk blocks, not flash blocks. In general, ‘‘block’’ means disk block, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
