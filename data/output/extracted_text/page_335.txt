FILE SYSTEMS

Since the bitmap is a fixed-size data structure, if the kernel is (partially) paged, the
bitmap can be put in virtual memory and have pages of it paged in as needed.
Disk Quotas
To prevent people from hogging too much disk space, multiuser operating 
systems often provide a mechanism for enforcing disk quotas. The idea is that the 
system administrator assigns each user a maximum allotment of files and blocks, and
the operating system makes sure that the users do not exceed their quotas. A 
typical mechanism is described below.
When a user opens a file, the attributes and disk addresses are located and put
into an open-file table in main memory. Among the attributes is an entry telling
who the owner is. Any increases in the file’s size will be charged to the owner’s
quota.
A second table contains the quota record for every user with a currently open
file, even if the file was opened by someone else. This table is shown in Fig. 4-26.
It is an extract from a quota file on disk for the users whose files are currently
open. When all the files are closed, the record is written back to the quota file.

Figure 4-26. Quotas are kept track of on a per-user basis in a quota table.
When a new entry is made in the open-file table, a pointer to the owner’s quota
record is entered into it, to make it easy to find the various limits. Every time a
block is added to a file, the total number of blocks charged to the owner is 
incremented, and a check is made against both the hard and soft limits. The soft limit
may be exceeded, but the hard limit may not. An attempt to append to a file when
the hard block limit has been reached will result in an error. Analogous checks also
exist for the number of files to prevent a user from hogging all the i-nodes.
