HISTORY OF WINDOWS THROUGH WINDOWS 11

Like the first version of MS-DOS-based Windows, NT-based Windows was
not initially successful. NT required more memory, there were few 32-bit 
applications available, and incompatibilities with device drivers and applications caused
many customers to stick with MS-DOS-based Windows which Microsoft was still
improving, releasing Windows 95 in 1995. Windows 95 provided native 32-bit
programming interfaces like NT, but better compatibility with existing 16-bit 
software and applications. Not surprisingly, NTâ€™s early success was in the server 
market, competing with VMS and NetWare.
NT did meet its portability goals, with additional releases in 1994 and 1995
adding support for (little-endian) MIPS and PowerPC architectures. The first major
upgrade to NT came with Windows NT 4.0 in 1996. This system had the power,
security, and reliability of NT, but also sported the same user interface as the 
bythen very popular Windows 95.
Figure 11-3 shows the relationship of the Win32 API to Windows. Having a
common API across both the MS-DOS-based and NT-based Windows was 
important to the success of NT.

This compatibility made it much easier for users to migrate from Windows 95
to NT, and the operating system became a strong player in the high-end desktop
market as well as servers. However, customers were not as willing to adopt other
processor architectures, and of the four architectures Windows NT 4.0 supported in
1996, only the x86 (i.e., Pentium family) was still actively supported by the time of
the next major release, Windows 2000.
Windows 2000 represented a significant evolution for NT. The key 
technologies added were plug-and-play (for consumers who installed a new PCI card, 
eliminating the need to fiddle with jumpers), network directory services (for enterprise
customers), improved power management (for notebook computers), and an
improved GUI (for everyone).
The technical success of Windows 2000 led Microsoft to push toward the 
deprecation of Windows 98 by enhancing the application and device compatibility of
the next NT release, Windows XP. Windows XP included a friendlier new
