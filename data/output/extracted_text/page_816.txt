which it is to be mounted, and other information. The mount program parses the
name of the remote directory to be mounted and discovers the name of the NFS
server on which the remote directory is located. It then contacts that machine, 
asking for a file handle for the remote directory. If the directory exists and is available
for remote mounting, the server returns a file handle for the directory. Finally, it
makes a mount system call, passing the handle to the kernel.
The kernel then constructs a v-node for the remote directory and asks the NFS
client code in Fig. 10-36 to create an r-node (remote i-node) in its internal tables
to hold the file handle. The v-node points to the r-node. Each v-node in the VFS
layer will ultimately contain either a pointer to an r-node in the NFS client code, or
a pointer to an i-node in one of the local file systems (shown as dashed lines in
Fig. 10-36). Thus, from the v-node it is possible to see if a file or directory is local
or remote. If it is local, the correct file system and i-node can be located. If it is
remote, the remote host and file handle can be located.
When a remote file is opened on the client, at some point during the parsing of
the path name, the kernel hits the directory on which the remote file system is
mounted. It sees that this directory is remote and in the directoryâ€™s v-node finds
the pointer to the r-node. It then asks the NFS client code to open the file. The
NFS client code looks up the remaining portion of the path name on the remote
server associated with the mounted directory and gets back a file handle for it. It
makes an r-node for the remote file in its tables and reports back to the VFS layer,
