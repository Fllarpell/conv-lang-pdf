FILE SYSTEMS
CHAP. 4
The first path instructs the system to go upward (to the usr directory), then to go
down to the directory lib to find the file dictionary.

The second argument (dot) names the current directory. When the cp command
gets a directory name (including dot) as its last argument, it copies all the files to
that directory. Of course, a more normal way to do the copy would be to use the
full absolute path name of the source file:
cp /usr/lib/dictionary .
Here the use of dot saves the user the trouble of typing dictionary a second time.
Nevertheless, typing
cp /usr/lib/dictionary dictionar y
also works fine, as does
cp /usr/lib/dictionary /usr/ast/dictionar y
All of these do exactly the same thing.
