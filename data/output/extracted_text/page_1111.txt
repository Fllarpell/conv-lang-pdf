12.5.4 No Silver Bullet
In addition to The Mythical Man Month, Brooks also wrote an influential paper
called ‘‘No Silver Bullet’’ (Brooks, 1987). In it, he argued that none of the many
nostrums being hawked by various people at the time was going to generate an
order-of-magnitude improvement in software productivity within a decade. 
Experience shows that he was right.
Among the silver bullets that were proposed were better high-level languages,
object-oriented programming, artificial intelligence, expert systems, automatic 
programming, graphical programming, program verification, and programming 
environments. Perhaps the next decade will see a silver bullet, but maybe we will have
to settle for gradual, incremental improvements.
PROBLEMS
1. Moore’s Law describes a phenomenon of exponential growth similar to the population
growth of an animal species introduced into a new environment with abundant food
and no natural enemies. In nature, an exponential growth curve is likely eventually to
become a sigmoid curve with an asymptotic limit when food supplies become limiting
or predators learn to take advantage of new prey. Discuss some factors that may 
eventually limit the rate of improvement of computer hardware.
2. In Fig. 12-1, two paradigms are shown, algorithmic and event driven. For each of the
following kinds of programs, which of the following paradigms is likely to be easiest
to use?
