state information representing what the user currently sees that it returns to the
activity manager; the activity manager, running in the system server process,
retains that state in its ActivityRecord for that activity. The saved state for an 
activity is generally small, for example containing where you are scrolled in an email
message; it would not contain data like the message itself, which the app would
instead keep somewhere in its own persistent storage (so it remains around even if
the user completely removes an activity).
Recall that although Android does demand paging (it can page in and out clean
RAM that has been mapped from files on disk, such as code), it does not rely on
swap space. This means all dirty RAM pages in an application’s process must stay
in RAM. Having the email’s main activity state safely stored away in the activity
manager gives the system back some of the flexibility in dealing with memory that
swap provides.
For example, if the camera application starts to require a lot of RAM, the 
system can simply get rid of the email process, as shown in Fig. 10-54. The 
ActivityRecord, with its precious saved state, remains safely tucked away by the activity
manager in the system server process. Since the system server process hosts all of
Android’s core system services, it must always remain running, so the state saved
here will remain around for as long as we might need it.
Our example email application not only has an activity for its main UI, but
includes another ComposeActivity. Applications can declare any number of 
activities they want. This can help organize the implementation of an application, but
more importantly it can be used to implement cross-application interactions. For
example, this is the basis of Android’s cross-application sharing system, which the
