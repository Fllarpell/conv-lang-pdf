Figure 1-14. A file system for a university department.
The process and file hierarchies both are organized as trees, but the similarity
stops there. Process hierarchies usually are not very deep (more than fiv e levels is
unusual), whereas file hierarchies are commonly six, seven, or even more levels
deep. Process hierarchies are typically more short-lived than directory hierarchies
which may exist for years. Ownership and protection also differ for processes and
files. Typically, only a parent process may control or even access a child process,
but mechanisms nearly always exist to allow files and directories to be read by a
wider group than just the owner.
Every file within the directory hierarchy can be specified by giving its path
name from the top of the directory hierarchy, the root directory. Such absolute
path names consist of the list of directories that must be traversed from the root
directory to get to the file, with slashes separating the components. In Fig. 1-14,
the path for file CS101 is /Faculty/Prof.Brown/Courses/CS101. The leading slash
indicates that the path is absolute, that is, starting at the root directory. As an aside,
in Windows, the backslash (\) character is used as the separator instead of the slash
(/) character (for historical reasons), so the file path given above would be written
as \Faculty\Prof.Brown\Courses\CS101. Throughout this book, we will generally
use the UNIX convention for paths.
At every instant, each process has a current working directory, in which path
names not beginning with a slash are looked for. For example, in Fig. 1-14, if
