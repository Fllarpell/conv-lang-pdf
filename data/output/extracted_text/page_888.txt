notifications is an example of creating incentives that achieve the desired outcome:
in this case a strong disincentive to abuse foreground services, because the 
associated notification will annoy people and give them a negative impression of the app.
The battery usage display is an example of creating accountability: making visible
the things applications are doing that can have significant impact on the device, so
they can be held accountable for bad behavior and allow the user to take action
based on that.
Neither of these approaches helps address the tragedy of the commons 
problem, where many reasonably behaving apps together consume too much power. It
is difficult to find incentives that would significantly change the decisions those
apps make (or even clearly say what the right decision is for each app), and
accountability from battery usage data would simply show a large number of apps
each individually using a small amount of the overall power. This was not initially
a significant issue for Android, but as time went on, and devices had increasing
numbers of apps installed on them, and those apps grew increasing amounts of
functionality, it needed to be addressed.
Android 5.0 made the first major step at addressing cross-app power 
consumption problems with the introduction of the JobScheduler API. This provides a new
specialized kind of service, one the app does not explicitly start or bind to, but
instead tells the platform information about when it should run, such as whether it
