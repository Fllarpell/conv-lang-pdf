manages physical memory in such a way that it can acquire an arbitrary-sized
piece of memory at will. The algorithm it uses is known as the buddy algorithm
and is described below.
Memory-Allocation Mechanisms
Linux supports several mechanisms for memory allocation. The main 
mechanism for allocating new page frames of physical memory is the page allocator,
which operates using the well-known buddy algorithm.
The basic idea for managing a chunk of memory is as follows. Initially 
memory consists of a single contiguous piece, 64 pages in the simple example of
Fig. 10-17(a). When a request for memory comes in, it is first rounded up to a
power of 2, say eight pages. The full memory chunk is then divided in half, as
shown in (b). Since each of these pieces is still too large, the lower piece is divided
in half again (c) and again (d). Now we hav e a chunk of the correct size, so it is
allocated to the caller, as shown shaded in (d).

Now suppose that a second request comes in for eight pages. This can be 
satisfied directly now (e). At this point, a third request comes in for four pages. The
smallest available chunk is split (f) and half of it is claimed (g). Next, the second
of the 8-page chunks is released (h). Finally, the other eight-page chunk is
released. Since the two adjacent just-freed eight-page chunks came from the same
16-page chunk, they are merged to get the 16-page chunk back (i).
Linux manages memory using the buddy algorithm, with the additional feature
of having an array in which the first element is the head of a list of blocks of size 1
unit, the second element is the head of a list of blocks of size 2 units, the next 
element points to the 4-unit blocks, and so on. In this way, any power-of-2 block can
be found quickly.
This algorithm leads to considerable internal fragmentation because if you
want a 65-page chunk, you have to ask for and get a 128-page chunk.
