Problem 2: 
An object of mass m = 50 g slides with the zero initial velocity down an 
inclined plane set at an angle α = 30° to the horizontal. It successfully slides down, 
then covers the distance of 50 cm on the horizontal plane, and stops. Find the 
work (in J, round to 2 decimal places) performed by the friction forces over 
the whole distance, assuming the friction coefficient k = 0.15 for both inclined 
and horizontal planes. 
 
Given: 
𝑚 = 50 ⋅10−3𝑘𝑔 
𝑉0 = 0 𝑚∕𝑠 
𝛼= 300 
𝑘= 0,15 
𝑠1 = 0,5 𝑚 
 
Find:  
The total work 𝑊 
 
 
Solution:  
Calculate acceleration 𝛼1 down the incline: 
𝛼1 = 𝑔(sin(𝑎) −𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑎)) = 9.81 ⋅(𝑠𝑖𝑛300 ⋅𝑐𝑜𝑠300) ≈3.21 m/s2  
Calculate velocity 𝑉𝐴 at the end of the incline: 
𝑉𝐴= √2𝛼1𝑠1 = √2 ⋅3.21 ⋅1.5 ≈1.79 𝑚∕𝑠 
Calculate deceleration 𝑎2 on the horizontal surface:  
𝑎2 = −𝑘𝑔= −0.15 ⋅9.81 ≈−1.47 𝑚∕𝑠2 
Calculate distance 𝑠2 on the horizontal plane using 𝑉𝐴: 
𝑆2 =

2 ⋅1.47 ≈0.55 𝑚 
Calculate work 𝑊1 done by friction on the inclined plane: 
𝑊2 = −𝑘𝑔𝑚⋅𝑠2 = −0.15 ⋅0.05 ⋅9.81 ⋅0.55 ≈−0.04 𝐽 
Calculate the total work 𝑊: 
𝑊= 𝑊1 + 𝑊2 = −0.03 + (−0.04) = −0.07 𝐽 
 
Answer:  
𝑊= −0.07 J
