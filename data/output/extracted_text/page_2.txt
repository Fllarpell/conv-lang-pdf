Problem 1: 
One particular glitch in the Mafia 3 video game resulted in the player’s 
character getting launched into the air after being intermittently stuck inside a 
motor boat. A hyper-realistic representation of this scene is shown in the Figure 
below. The known quantities are: mass of the character m = 80 kg, maximum 
launch height H = 70 m, initial penetration of the character’s feet into the boat’s 
hull x = 0.5 m. Answer the following:  
1. 
Assuming that the boat’s hull can be modeled as an ideal spring 
with the stiffness coefficient k, what should be the value of k (in N/m, round to 
nearest thousand) so that the character is launched into the air by a given height 
H. Neglect air drag (15 pts).   
2. 
What is the maximum character’s speed 𝒗𝒊 (in km/h, round to 1 
decimal place)? (10 pts).  
 
Given:  
𝑚= 80 𝑘𝑔 
𝐻= 70 𝑚 
𝑥= 0,5 𝑚 
 
Find: 
1. 𝑘 
2. 𝑣𝑖 
Solution: 
To find 𝑘, we apply the energy conservation principle. The initial elastic 
potential energy in the spring should be equal to the gravitational potential 
energy at height 𝐻: 
1
2 𝑘𝑥2 = 𝑚𝑔𝐻 
Solving for 𝑘: 
𝑘= 2𝑚𝑔𝐻
𝑥2
= 2 ⋅80 ⋅9,8 ⋅70
0, 52
= 439040 𝑁/𝑚 
To determine the maximum launch speed 𝑣𝑖, we consider the point where 
the entire initial elastic potential energy is converted to kinetic energy: 
1
2 𝑘𝑥2 = 1
2 𝑚𝑣𝑖
2 
Rearranging to solve for 𝑣𝑖: 
𝑣𝑖= 𝑥√𝑘
𝑚=  0,5√439040
80
= 37,04 𝑚𝑠
⁄ = 133,3 𝑘𝑚/ℎ 
 
Answer:  
1. 𝑘= 439000 𝑁, 𝑚
2. 𝑣𝑖= 133,3 𝑘𝑚∕ℎ
