PREFACE
in most major operating systems, most popular browsers, and all modern Intel
processors. He believes that offensive research is valuable because the main reason
for todayâ€™s security problems is that systems have become so complex that we no
longer understand them. By investigating how we can make systems behave in
unintended ways, we learn more about their (real) nature. Armed with this 
knowledge, developers can then improve their designs in the future. Indeed, while
sophisticated new attacks tend to feature prominently in the media, Herbert spends
most of his time on developing defensive techniques to improve the security.
His (former) students are all awesome and much cleverer than he is. With
them, he has won fiv e Pwnie Awards at the Black Hat conference in Las Veg as.
Moreover, fiv e of his students have won the ACM SIGOPS EuroSys Roger 
Needham Award for best European Ph.D. thesis in systems, two of them have won the
ACM SIGSAC Doctoral Dissertation Award for best Ph.D. thesis in security, and
two more won the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award for their work on
dependability. Herbert worries about climate change and loves the Beatles.
