Figure 4-32. The MS-DOS directory entry.
The directory entry also contains the date and time the file was created or last
modified. The time is accurate only to ±2 sec because it is stored in a 2-byte field,
which can store only 65,536 unique values (a day contains 86,400 seconds). The
time field is subdivided into seconds (5 bits), minutes (6 bits), and hours (5 bits).
The date counts in days using three subfields: day (5 bits), month (4 bits), and year
< 1980 (7 bits). With a 7-bit number for the year and time beginning in 1980, the
highest expressible year is 2107. Thus. MS-DOS has a built-in Y2108 problem.
To avoid catastrophe, MS-DOS users should begin with Y2108 compliance as
early as possible. If MS-DOS had used the combined date and time fields as a
32-bit seconds counter, it could have represented every second exactly and delayed
the catastrophe until 2116.
MS-DOS stores the file size as a 32-bit number, so in theory files can be as
large as 4 GB. However, other limits (described below) restrict the maximum file
size to 2 GB or less. A surprisingly large part of the entry (10 bytes) is unused.
MS-DOS keeps track of file blocks via a file allocation table in main memory.
The directory entry contains the number of the first file block. This number is used
as an index into a 64K entry FAT in main memory. By following the chain, all the
blocks can be found. The operation of the FAT is illustrated in Fig. 4-14.
The FAT file system comes in three versions: FAT -12, FAT -16, and FAT -32,
depending on how many bits a disk address contains. Actually, FAT -32 is 
something of a misnomer, since only the low-order 28 bits of the disk addresses are
used. It should have been called FAT -28, but powers of two sound so much neater.
Another variant of the FAT file system is exFAT , which Microsoft introduced
for large removable devices. Apple licensed exFAT , so that there is one modern file
system that can be used to transfer files both ways between Windows and MacOS
computers. Since exFAT is proprietary and Microsoft has not released the 
specification, we will not discuss it further here.
For all FATs, the disk block can be set to some multiple of 512 bytes (possibly
different for each partition), with the set of allowed block sizes (called cluster
sizes by Microsoft) being different for each variant. The first version of MS-DOS
used FAT -12 with 512-byte blocks, giving a maximum partition size of 212 × 512
